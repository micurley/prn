California for over 25 years, with an emphasis on disadvantaged youth, the child welfare system and education. <br />
  From a Congressional appointment, Joachim attended the US Military Academy at West Point through a Congressional appointment in the late 1960s. <br />
 After clashing with the system he was railroaded out at the end of his third year. <br />
This resulted in Joachim filing charges against the academy with failure to allow due process and he won the case in a New York federal district court. <br />
This case set the precedent that continues today for cadets the right to present their case and witness before the academy. <br />
Joachim’s story is retold in his manuscript book “Don’t Let The Bastards Getcha Down.<br />
”  His writings focus on education, geopolitics, the national security and police state, and international relations for Global Research, many which have been featured on the Public Radio Network and Boiling Frogs. <br />
His articles can be found at GlobalResearch.ca under Hagopian, and his West Point book at RedRedSea.<br />

Since then, Ross went on to found and direct the Justice for Fallujah Project, a group of veterans, students and citizens dedicated to raising awareness about the suffering of the people of Fallujah, and the US’s war crimes committed there. <br />
Among the Projects board members are Noam Chomsky and journalist Dahr Jamail. <br />
He is also the director of the recent documentary film “Fear Not the Path of Truth: A Veterans Journey After Fallujah”  Ross holds an MA in linguistics, has written for Globalresearch and Guardian, and his website is TheFallujaProject.<br />
