nation’s greatest Jewish intellectuals and spiritual political activists. <br />
As a teenager, Rabbi Lerner was a student of Abraham Joshua Heschel, a great socially responsible mystical thinker who marched with Martin Luther King.
<br />
During the 60s, he was a chair of the Berkeley chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society and among the Seattle Seven while teaching at the University of Washington, 
Rabbi Lerner is the editor in chief of Tikkun Magazine—an award winning journal of interfaith and progressive critiques on American culture, politics, and religion. <br />
He is the rabbi of Beyt Tikkun Synagogue Without Walls in San Francisco, and the founder of the interfaith, humanist organization the Network of Spiritual Progressives. <br />
His most recent book is “Embracing Israel/Palestine: A Strategy to Heal and Transform the Middle East” — praised by people like Jimmy Carter, Uri Avnery, Desmond Tutu, Senator Keith Ellison and others as the most insightful treatment and understanding of the roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and offering a roadmap for bringing peace to the region.  His websites are tikkun.org  and  SpiritualProgressives.org<br />
