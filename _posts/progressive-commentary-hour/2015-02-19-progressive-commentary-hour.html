He is the author of several books including “Dogmatism in Science and Medicine: How Dominant Theories Monopolize Research and Stifle the Search for Truth, and earlier “The Origin, Persistence and Failings of HIV/AIDS Theory,”  which was among the first books to gather together two decades of research on HIV and AIDS and to identify the scientific contradictions.<br />
