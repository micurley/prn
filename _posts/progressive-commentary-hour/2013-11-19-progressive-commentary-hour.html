We are fortunate to have with us today a key person who was a witness to the assassination of president John F Kennedy<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
in Dallas on November 22, 1963. <br />
During the events, he had received a minor wound on his right check from a ricochet bullet or concrete fragment from a shot that had hit a curb close to where he was standing. <br />
Aside from Kennedy and Texas governor John Connally, James is the only other person who was wounded by gunfire for many years conducted his own investigation into the JFK assassination, receiving various documents and correspondence, and conducting many interviews with people who might add additional pieces to the puzzle.
<br />


His personal account was published in his book “Truth Withheld”. His most recent book is “LBJ and the Kennedy Killing.”<br />
