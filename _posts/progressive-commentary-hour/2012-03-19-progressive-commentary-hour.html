The Failures of our largest Environmental organizations and their sell out corporate polluters
Derrick Jensen
Derrick<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Jensen has become one of the nation’s leading voices of cultural and environmental dissent, who writes on how civilization is devastating the environment and the natural world, and our society’s denial of that fact. <br />
In 2008, Utne Reader listed Derrick among the 50 visionaries changing the world. <br />
In sharp contrast to environmental optimists who believe working within the corporate system will offset the tenuous planetary balance threatened by climate change, Derrick has advocated for many years a “dismantling of civilization” which can include radical dissent as well as imparting wisdom to our children.
<br />
He has received many awards for his writings, including the two “Endgame” volumes. <br />
His most recent book “Dreams” is a critique against the fundamentalist Christian legalist morality and materialist scientism hat define western civilization and reinforce their disregard and violence against nature.
