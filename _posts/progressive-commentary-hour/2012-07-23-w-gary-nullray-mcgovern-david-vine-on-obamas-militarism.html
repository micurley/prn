The military legacy of President Obama and expansion of the American empire with distinguished guests Ray McGovern and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Prof. <br />
David Vine.
<br />
Vine is professor of Anthropology at American University and author of ‘Island of Shame: the Secret history of the US Military Base on Diego Garcia’
Ray McGovern served as an Army intelligence officer and a CIA analyst from the administration of John F. <br />
Kennedy to that of George H. <br />
W. <br />
Bush. <br />
Among his duties was preparing the President’s Daily Brief, which he briefed one-on-one to President Ronald Reagan’s most senior national security advisers. <br />
Since retiring from government service, he has been one of our nation’s most vocal peace activists and journalists. <br />
As an act of conscience, in 2006 Ray returned the Intelligence Commendation Medallion given him at retirement for “especially meritorious service.<br />
” In 2003, he helped create Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) to expose the way intelligence was being falsified to “justify” war on Iraq.
<br />
Ray’s opinion pieces appear in many leading newspapers here and abroad, including a major section in an important book, “Neocon’d Again” dealing with America’s war in Iraq. <br />
He holds degrees in theology and philosophy from Fordham University, is a graduate from Harvard Business School and has a certificate of theology from Georgetown University. <br />
