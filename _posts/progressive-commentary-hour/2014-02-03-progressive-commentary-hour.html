Dr Peter D. <br />

After his sons were born, Peter became actively involved in environmental, climate change and sustainable development issues. <br />
He is a founding director of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, the founder of the Climate Emergency Institute and was an expert reviewer for the IPCC fifth climate change assessment. <br />
He has presented on sustainable development, environmental health policy, biodiversity, climate change and human rights protection issues in Canada, the US and overseas. <br />
Since 2007, Peter has developed a unique approach to climate change risk that has been published in scientific journals. <br />
He has documented the science that shows we are already far beyond “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. <br />
This science shows that the world is facing planetary catastrophe from multiple amplifying feedbacks in the Arctic and will contribute to catastrophic crop declines.
