extensively since 1987, in various magazines. <br />
Some of these writings are collected in her book: “Serious Adverse Events: An Uncensored History of AIDS” published by Melville House Press, (now Random House) in 2006. <br />

Activist Michael Callen called Farber “..the best AIDS journalist in the world.<br />
”  She also has enemies, of course. <br />
Her 2006 article for Harper’s magazine detailing the totalitarian corruption of HIV/AIDS research was titled “Out of Control: AIDS And The Corruption of Medical Science.<br />
” The attacks from the AIDS industry were predictable and fierce. <br />
Still, she won the 2008 Semmelweis Clean Hands Award for Outstanding Investigative Journalism.

<br />

He hosts the www.ReThinkingAIDS.com website, which is science and news resource on all international research and commentary challenging the current HIV/AIDS model.<br />
