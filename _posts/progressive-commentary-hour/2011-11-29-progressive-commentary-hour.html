Some of these writings are collected in her book: “Serious Adverse Events: An Uncensored History of AIDS” published by Melville House Press, (now Random House) in 2006. <br />

Activist Michael Callen called Farber “..the best AIDS journalist in the world.<br />
”  She also has enemies, of course. <br />
Her 2006 article for Harper’s magazine detailing the totalitarian corruption of HIV/AIDS research was titled “Out of Control: AIDS And The Corruption of Medical Science.<br />
” The attacks from the AIDS industry were predictable and fierce. <br />
Still, she won the 2008 Semmelweis Clean Hands Award for Outstanding Investigative Journalism.

He hosts the www.ReThinkingAIDS.com website, which is science and news resource on all international research and commentary challenging the current HIV/AIDS model.<br />
