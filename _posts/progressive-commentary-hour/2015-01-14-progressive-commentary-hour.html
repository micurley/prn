The nature of power and influence and its tendency towards abuse - with Chris Hedges and Joachim Hagopian
Chris Hedges<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
is one of our nation’s most insightful cultural critics, social and political activists and authors. <br />
For almost 20 years he was a foreign correspondent in war zones and conflicts in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans, having reported for The New York Times, Christian Science Monitor and other news outlets.<br />
  While at the Times, Chris received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on global terrorism. <br />
The same year he received Amnesty International’s Global Award for Human Rights Journalism.<br />
  Over the years he has taught at Columbia, Princeton, NYU and the University of Toronto.
<br />
Among Chris’ many noteworthy books, his latest is “Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt”  – a hard compelling look at the most impoverished regions in the US that have become what Chris calls “sacrifice zones” for the benefit of the powerful and wealthy.  Chris’ weekly column can be read very Monday at Truthdig.<br />

Joachim Hagopian has been a practicing clinical psychologist and counselor practicing in California for over 25 years, with an emphasis on disadvantaged youth, family abuse, the child welfare system and education. <br />
Joachim attended the US Military Academy at West Point through a Congressional appointment in the late 1960s.<br />
  After clashing with the system he was railroaded out at the end of his third year. <br />
This resulted in Joachim filing charges against the academy with failure to allow due process and won the case in a New York federal district court. <br />
This case set the precedent that continues today for cadets the have the right to present their case and witness before the academy. <br />
Joachim’s story is retold in his manuscript book “Don’t Let The Bastards Getcha Down.<br />
”  His writings focus on education, geopolitics, the national security and police state, and international relations for Global Research, many which have been featured on the Public Radio Network and Boiling Frogs. <br />
His articles can be found at GlobalResearch.ca, and his West Point book is available at RedRedSea.net.<br />
