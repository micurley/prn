dysfunction and the emergence of a new culture
Professor Ashok Gangadean is the distinguished Margaret Gest Professor of Global Philosophy at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, where he has taught for almost 40 years. <br />
His life long study and passion has been to clarify the common ground at the heart of human reason and to promote a deeper dialogue to bring forth a more integral and holistic global consciousness, which can remedy the apocalyptic fervor associated with our fragmented world.  Ashok is the founder of the Global Dialogue Institute, a co-founder of the World Commission on Global Consciousness and Spirituality (which includes Ervin Lazslo, Desmond Tutu, Hazel Henderson, Jane Goodall, Robert Thurman, Cornell West), and he is the host of the award winning program Global Lens on PBS in Philadelphia.<br />
  Among his books are Meditative Reason: Toward a Universal Grammar  and  Between Worlds: The Emergence of Global Reason.
