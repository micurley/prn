Derrick Jensen has become one of the nation’s leading voices of cultural and environmental dissent, who writes on how<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
civilization is devastating the environment and the natural world, and our society’s denial of that fact. <br />
In 2008, Utne Reader listed Derrick among the 50 visionaries changing the world. <br />
In sharp contrast to environmental optimists who believe working within the corporate system will offset the tenuous planetary balance threatened by climate change, Derrick has advocated for many years a “dismantling of civilization” which can include radical dissent as well as imparting wisdom to our children.
<br />
“The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution”  was recently published by Seven Stories with a remarkable collection of his collected writings including his 2 volume best-seller Endgame,” “A Language Older Than Words”, “As The World Burns” and others.  His website is www.DerrickJensen.org
Dr Guy McPherson is a professor emeritus of Natural Resources, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.<br />
  He has specialized in forest resources, energy decline and climate change and their economic consequences, and has also taught at Texas A&amp;M and University of California at Berkeley.
<br />
Having become disillusioned with the American university environment and education, after attempts to silent his outspokenness views on the human causes of climate change and environmental devastation, Guy abandoned his tenured position as a full professor for ethical reasons of conscience.
<br />
His story is described in a memoir, “Walking Away from Empire” found on his website   www.GuyMcpherson.com
