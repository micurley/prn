US government negligence in exposing US troops to dangerous chemicals, toxins and bioweapons and the coverup
Dr.

Doug Rokke is an expert in depleted uranium and its health risks. <br />
Having served in the US armed forces for four decades, including combat duty in Vietnam and Gulf War 1, he is a retired Major who served as the US Army’s Depleted Uranium Project Director in the mid-90s, and developed the congressionally mandated education and training materials for handling with depleted uranium incidents.
<br />
Dr Rokke has taught nuclear, biological and chemical warfare and emergency medicine for 25 years and has served as an advisor to the CDC, the US Institute of Medicine, the US Senate, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies and departments. <br />
He is also a retired professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana.
<br />
Doug is included in Who’s Who in America and has been nominated Who’s Who in the World. <br />
Due to his outspoken concerns and warnings over depleted uranium’s horrible health risks to military personnel, he has been subject to ongoing retaliation by the Department of Defense who have for years denied any adverse health and environmental effects from uranium weapons.
<br />
He is the co-host of “Warrior Connection” heard every Sunday evening at 7:00 pm Eastern time on the Progressive Radio Network. 
Major Denise Nichols is a Chairwoman for the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition.<br />
  She is retired Major and a registered flight nurse from the US Air Force having served in both the Vietnam and Gulf War campaign. <br />
During Operation Desert Storm she served on the border of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. <br />
Although her unit was theoretically in the exposure zone where depleted uranium demolition occurred, the Department of Defense did not include Air Force units among those under chemical threat. <br />
She has testified before Congress on behalf of veterans and has been interviewed nationally and internationally on issues concerning Gulf War Illness and Agent Orange.<br />
  Since retiring from the Air Force she has been a teacher on nursing faculties at several universities. <br />

  He is also a published poet and administrates the largest closed group on Facebook dealing with Gulf War Illness. <br />
