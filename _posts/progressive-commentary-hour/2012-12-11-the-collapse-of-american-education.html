The rise of cyber education
The demise of critical thinking in education that threatens democracy and free speech
Professor Henry Giroux (Jeer-oh) holds the Global Television Network Chair of English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University in Ontario Canada and is regarded as a leader in the field known as critical and public pedagogy – a term to describe the nature of spectacle in our new media, body politic and corporate education.<br />
  He is a prominent advocate of radical democracy, which opposes the powers of neoliberalism, corporatism, and religious fundamentalism that is now diminishing our population’s sense of civic virtue, free-thought and well being. <br />
He has been named among the top fifty educational thinkers of the modern Period. <br />
 Henry has authored many books, his most recent being “Twilight of the Social: Resurgent Publics in the Age of Disposability”
Danny Weil is a progressive public intellectual and scholar and a publishing editor of young adult reference books on education.<br />
  He is frequent contributor to alternative media focusing on the privatization of education and charter schools, the student loan crisis, civil rights and free and democracy.
