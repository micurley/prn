Today on “This Can’t Be Happening!
<!--more-->
 journalist Alfredo Lopez talks with colleague and host Dave Lindorff about two stories that intimately concern him. <br />
The first is a fierce attack by anti-abortion forces, most likely by hired experts located in Russia or China, on a progressive web-hosting service Lopez helped found, MayFirst.<br />
org. <br />
Lopez then talks about the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, arguably as bad or worse than the crisis in Greece, but far harder to combat because of the island’s colonial status under US domination.
