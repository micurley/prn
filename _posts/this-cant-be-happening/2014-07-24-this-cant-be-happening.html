Dave Lindorff riffs on the weeks two big news events: the Israeli assault on the ghetto of Gaza, and the downing of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine. <br />
Drawing comparisons between Israel’s murderous military campaign against the trapped Palestinians of Gaza, where 75 percent of the victims are civilians, half of them children, and the Nazi assault on the Warsaw Ghetto in World War II, he notes that it is mostly US-supplied weapons that are being used to do the IDF’s killing. <br />
As for the airline downing, Lindorff scoffs at US claims to have “proof” that it was the doing of Russia and the pro-Russian rebels of eastern Ukraine, saying that it was much more likely the work of the Ukraining military, perhaps with help or direction from the CIA.
