title: This Can’t Be HappeningSaving The Internet
---
On this edition of PRN’s new show “This Can’t Be Happening,” we talk about Saving the Internet!
<!--more-->

Gurst Alfredo Lopez, a life-long political activist, member of the ThisCantBeHappening! <br />
collective and founder of the progressive web hosting service MayFirst/PeopleLink, says that the Web is an extraordinary development in global communication and a huge force for democratization that should be a human right. <br />
But he warns that it is right now being stolen away by powerful commercial and political forces in the US. <br />
Lopez calls for municipalities, like New York City, to fight back by establishing municipally-owned and run hosting services<br />
