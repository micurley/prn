Dr.
<!--more-->
Kris Neuhaus, an associate of the murdered Kansas abortion doctor George Tiller, has been the target for since his death of rabid anti-abortionists in that state. <br />
She talks with host Dave Lindorff about a new law passed in Kansas that bars a standard, safe procedure for second-term abortions, jeopardizing the health of many Kansas women. <br />
Dr Neuhaus also talks about her struggle to regain the medical license stolen from her by the state’s so-called Board of Healing Arts (a body stacked with non doctors whose only qualification is their anti-abortion stance), and her struggle to save the family farm in the face of a $100,000 bill by that board for the “costs” of their hearing to cancel her license. <br />
