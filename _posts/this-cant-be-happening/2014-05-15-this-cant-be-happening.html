The case of Occupy activist Cecily McMillan, currently jailed at Riker’s Island without bail while awaiting sentencing<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
for felony assault of a police office, is discussed by her attorney, Martin Stolar, and by Lucy Parks, a member of her support team at JusticeforCecily.<br />
com. <br />
Stolar explains the judge prevented McMillan’s defense from making their case to the jury that she had not assaulted police officer, but had in fact been the victim of assault when the officer grabbed her right breast from behind her, causing her instinctively to throw up her arms, hitting him in the eye with an elbow. <br />
Both Stolar and Parks say the charge against McMillan, and the Judge’s handling of the case and refusal to grant bail show that it’s really about sending a message that protest in New York City, especially against the banking industry, won’t be tolerated.
