In an exclusive intervew on PRN’s “This Can’t Be Happening!
<!--more-->
 program, Occupy Wall Street activist Cecily McMillan, just released from two months’ detention in the Women’s Prison on Riker’s Island, talks about her conviction on a trumped-up charge of felony assault of a New York Police Officer, explaining how he had actually grabbed her breast from behind, causing significant bruising, and then threw her to the ground where she was further injured. <br />
McMillan, who refused a plea bargain offered by Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, Jr. <br />
that would have left her with a felony conviction but perhaps no jail time, insisting on a full trial, tells host Dave Lindorff how she was barred from presenting evidence to the jury about the cop’s histrory of brutality and corruption. <br />
She also talks of what she learned about the horrors of Rikers Island, where some of her cellmates were still waiting up to five years just to be tried and sentenced, where humiliation and deprivation are the norm, and where rehabilitation is just a word.
<br />
