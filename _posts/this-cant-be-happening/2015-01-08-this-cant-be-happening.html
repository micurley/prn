Alfredo Lopez, founder of the progressive web-hosting service MayFirst.org, reveals to host Dave Lindorff how from<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
September 5 through December 17, his organization and MayFirst.<br />
org’s entire executive committee were held in gagged silence about a US Justice Department subpoena for information on one of their servers regarding an Indy Media Center web site in Greece being investigated by Greek police. <br />
Lopez says not only was the subpoena itself a first-amendment violating act, but the gag order that made it a felony for him or his fellow executive board members to even mention the court order violated their freedom of speech and their ability to organize resistance to the action. <br />
This police state action also threatened our newssite, thiscantbehappening.net, which is hosted by MayFirst.<br />
org, Lindorff says. <br />
Lopez, a frequent visitor to Cuba, also talks about the significance of the US agreement to recognize the Cuban government after 54 years of a war-footing towards the island.
