Host Dave Lindorff interviews David Swanson, labor and peace activist, author of the book “War No More: The Case for<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Abolition” and the website warisacrime.<br />
org, about the rapidly expanding crises that the US ha been promoting in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and the many countries where the US is using attack drones. <br />
Swanson argues that the US has been working hard to make Russia into an enemy again, that after portraying Syrian leader Bushar al Assad as a “Hitler” and arming and training his islamic rebel enemies, now a year later, Washington sees Assad as the “good guy” and is gearing up to bomb and kill the rebels, both in Syria and in Iraq, where they have expanded their rebellion. <br />
At least two of the crises, in Ukraine and the Persian Gulf, where a Coast Guard vessel has fired at an Iranian vessel, there is a real risk of war, either against Russia or Iran, Swanson warns.
