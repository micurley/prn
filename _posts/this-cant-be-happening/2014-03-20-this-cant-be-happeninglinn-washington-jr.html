Investigative reporter Linn Washington, Jr., a renowned Philadelphia journalist, journalism professor and legal expert,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
tells “This Can’t Be Happening!<br />
” host Dave Lindorff how the Drug ‘War” is costing $50 billion a year in  law enforcement costs alone, and how users get years in jail while too-big-to-fail banks that are found to have laundered billions in drug money just pay fines. <br />
He also talks about how rampant police brutality, once largely reserved for minorities, is increasingly meted out to whites and blacks alike.
