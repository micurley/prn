long-time peace activist, talks about a Veterans for Peace campaign to counter the Pentagon’s latest PR initiative to rewrite the history of the Vietnam War. <br />
Grant says the VFP’s Vietnam War Full Disclosure Project is pressing the Pentagon to correct the historical falsehoods in it’s 50th Year Commemoration of the Vietnam War program. <br />
As part of that, the Full Disclosure Project is also asking veterans as well as peace activists who worked against that war to write “letters to the Wall” which will be delivered on Memorial Day to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, DC.
