Host Dave Lindorff Lindorff discussed the Sgt.
<!--more-->
Bowe Bergdahl case with fellow ThisCantBeHappening.<br />
net journalist John Grant, a Vietnam War veteran and long-time activist with Veterans for Peace. <br />
Grant says Bergdahl clearly was a young man questioning the war he found himself in, posted in a lonely, dangerous and remote mountain area much like where he grew up in his native Idaho. <br />
He says the case is a war of narratives, with conservative ‘chickenhawks’ in Congress and the media (and a ’senile’ Sen. <br />
John McCaine) trying to defend the Afghan War on one side, and anti-war people, and ultimately Bergdahl, exposing a war that makes no sense.
