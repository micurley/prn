title: Institutionalized Stupidity, American-Style
---
The American public’s bias against science. Preferred are bumper-sticker simplicities and faith.
<!--more-->
People read less, watch less news and embrace stupidity. <br />
Language has deteriorated. <br />
Universities don’t educate anymore: they train students to get jobs. <br />
Americans systematically vote against their own interests through ignorance. <br />
It is getting harder to avoid prosecution for laws we break that we’re not even aware of. <br />
More evidence against ‘the recovery’. <br />
Declines are evident in all areas. <br />
Real household income has been declining since 2000 and in some cases long before that – except in Washington DC where it hit an all-time high in 2012. <br />
Federal government excessive spending, perhaps? <br />
Analysts are usually wrong in their forecasts. <br />
They are all currently bullish and optimistic on the economy. <br />
Some burgeoning money supply statistics.
