title: Implications Of The Oil Price Drop
---
The recent oil drop has only happened once before in history.
<!--more-->
The unmistakable takeaway from history is that economic activity is slowing down. <br />
The concomitant fall in the price of copper equally attests to that. <br />
Listen to the consequences of this decline which are not pretty. <br />
They are massively negative. <br />
Last week’s price collapse really shows us how the economy is doing… how consumer spending is falling… how much poorer people have become as stock markets set records. <br />
Shale is being priced out of the market. <br />
The amount of money lost will be stupendous. <br />
America has hitherto been the hawk when it comes to war declarations. <br />
Putin is now rising to the challenge. <br />
This is very unsettling. <br />
A word about the unemployment statistics. <br />
We go into a lot of detail to show how false and artificial they are. <br />
Two Ivy League American professors are roaming the earth trying to encourage anyone who will listen to print more money and bury themselves in ‘stimulus’. <br />
Rogoff even wants to outlaw cash and make every transaction subject to electronic transfers. <br />
O course, Abe has listened to every word they’ve uttered! <br />
If they built a shrine to financial madmen and terrorists in Japan, Rogof and Krugman would be right at the top. <br />
Money is nothing more than a medium of exchange. <br />
It’s interesting to trace money. <br />
Why every boom has to be followed by a bust.
