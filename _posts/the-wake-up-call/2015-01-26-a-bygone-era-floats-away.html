There used to be a valid phenomenon known as American Exceptionalism. It is no more. We examine its passing in detail.
<!--more-->
The creation of a different entity, freed from prior restraints morphed into the likeness of other nations, including a bland sameness that is the hallmark of American life today. <br />
Mediocrity results. <br />
More on war and the seeming obsession that governments seem to have to whip up warlike sentiments. <br />
It is all entirely hokey. <br />
We have a close look at the falseness of the reasoning behind the security apparatus, etc. <br />
and what it means to the people in general. <br />
The virulent anger and criticisms leveled at Russia seem to have no basis. <br />
There is no proof or evidence offered for the crazy assertions of the American government. <br />
The European debt situation and the recent Greek elections yesterday and the hopelessness of ‘QE’. <br />
Quick comment on the State of The Union speech from last week.
