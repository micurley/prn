And yet, this is only the beginning. <br />
Bernanke’s ‘experiments’ with QE have brought precisely nothing in terms of new wealth. <br />
This is terminal. <br />
They never discuss the consequences… because they don’t know what to say! <br />
The entire project is insane and built on an absurd construct. <br />
Talking about moving abroad and how to pluck up the courage to do so. <br />
Derivatives explained through the unfortunatel, real-life application of the oil market. <br />
The stock market itself: highly overbought, an accident waiting to happen… yet the stock market goes from strength to strength. <br />
More on the debt. <br />
The odious Alan Greenspan was interviewed recently and asked  what would happen in the future, His answer: “the central banks have no idea what they’re doing”. <br />
That’s a little rich coming from a moron who didn’t know what he was doing either! <br />
Capitalism has been entirely eviscerated by the Fed and the government.
