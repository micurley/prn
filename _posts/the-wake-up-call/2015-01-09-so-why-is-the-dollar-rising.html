title: So Why Is The Dollar Rising?

We approach this discussion by differentiating between ‘taxation regimes’ and ‘money-printing regimes’.
<!--more-->
Simply put, taxation regimes make more money if the country as a whole makes more money through increased wealth creation. <br />
Money-printing regimes try to increase their circulation zones since the injection of new money into the system can only be done by the equivalent creation of debt. <br />
This has nothing whatever to do with the creation and/or expansion of wealth. <br />
No reform of the system is possible without removing the money printers from power. <br />
More on the oil melt-down (still in progress). <br />
This is not having a positive effect on consumers’ desire to shop. <br />
Consumer discretionary spending is collapsing. <br />
The figures are truly alarming. <br />
An analysis of the unemployment report which was published today. <br />
Comparisons of today’s world with that depicted on George Orwell’s book, 1984 which is about a future where the UK descends into a totalitarian regime that’s in a perpetual state of war, propaganda and persecution. <br />
It’s all happening!
