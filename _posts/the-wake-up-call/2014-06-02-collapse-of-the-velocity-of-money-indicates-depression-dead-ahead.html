title: Collapse Of The Velocity Of Money Indicates Depression Dead Ahead
---
The velocity of money has fallen to an all-time, record low. This means that economic activity is grinding to a halt.
<!--more-->
An all-time record one out of every eight men in their prime working years (25-54) is not in the labor force. <br />
No amount of money-printing will bring them back. <br />
Printing money is as irrelevant to the problem as creating billions of cans of baked beans. <br />
(Actually that would be more useful: you can eat the beans but you can’t eat the money). <br />
I explain why the US is broke. <br />
The government is broke. <br />
“Owing the money to ourselves” is a malicious and spurious lie. <br />
All areas of government are insolvent including the Federal Reserve. <br />
US debt as a percentage of GDP is getting higher and higher. <br />
The situation is desperately critical but nobody can see it because the media cover it up. <br />
Stock market report. <br />
The China question. <br />
The hypocrisy of that evil and merciless institution: the IMF.
