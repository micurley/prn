Lessons from America’s entry into the First World War. Wilson’s about-turn.
<!--more-->
Like Obama, yet another war president awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. <br />
Who was it that said, “The world must be made safe for democracy”? <br />
Idealism, rich in the USA.<br />
, never misses a beat. <br />
Bernanke’s last day in office. <br />
We look at some comparisons between the way the Fed was at the beginning of his tenure and how it is today. <br />
Very sobering. <br />
Bernanke should be hanging his head in shame. <br />
The absurdity of the American mortgage system, courtesy of the Fed. <br />
No other country does things the American way. <br />
It is totally antithetical to good business practice. <br />
And it all started, like so much else which is rotten in the system, with FDR. <br />
Corruption in crime labs nationwide, motivating them to turn out results that will be favorable to prosecutors!
<br />
A big round of thanks to all of you who wrote/called in to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership. <br />
It seems we succeeded. <br />
The bill will not be presented for fast-track status. <br />
You did it! <br />
Well done. <br />
The nanny state is a powerful reason for you to leave the country. <br />
The rules and regulations are becoming intolerable and arbitrary. <br />
China’s economy is falling to pieces with a credit market well over 300% of GDP. <br />
It’s a bubble. <br />
Fundamental statistics are deteriorating every month now. <br />
Don’t listen to the polyannas. <br />
China’s situation is terminal.
<br />
