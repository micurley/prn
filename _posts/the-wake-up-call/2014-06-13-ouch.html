A full moon is occurring on Friday the 13th today.

Specifically, the full moon occurs at precisely 12:11 am EDT on Thursday night — ie, early Friday morning. <br />
That means the 13th will coincide with the full moon for residents of the Eastern time zone as well as South America, Europe, Africa and Asia but not the Central, Mountain or Pacific time zones. <br />
The next time this happens will be August 13, 2049. <br />
It’s pretty rare for these two events to fall on the same day. <br />
The last time it happened was October 13, 2000. <br />
The next time will be August 13, 2049. <br />

An update on derivatives. <br />
Eternal optimism, courtesy the mainstream media. <br />
The economy still declining sharply: the relevant statistics…<br />
