title: The Economic Nuts And Bolts Are Falling Apart

Plenty of evidence that we are going down exactly the same path as in the late 1920s (wild speculation, huge income<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

disparities, bubbles, etc.<br />
) and the final denouement cannot be any different. <br />
It is all ignored by the media and the public. <br />
The present high level of unemployment simply does not allow for economic growth. <br />
The case of the automotive industry and the dark shadows of subprime debt underlying the glowing reports of brisk car sales. <br />
The grim slowdown in China and the US municipalities being dragged underwater. <br />
The story of the too-big-to-fail banks, much bigger now than they were in 2008 at the time of the melt-down. <br />
Spainâ€™s authorities also lie about their economic situation. <br />
Target hiring 18,000 fewer temporary holiday season workers this year. <br />
Highly qualified ladies (MBAs, law degrees, other Masters degrees, etc.<br />
) looking for work as career nannies because they cannot find work elsewhere. <br />
More evidence that computers are taking jobs away. <br />
The desperate case of Japan. <br />
The BIS, the only global financial body to warn of the 2007/8 crisis is warning about the upcoming one which promises to be even worse.
