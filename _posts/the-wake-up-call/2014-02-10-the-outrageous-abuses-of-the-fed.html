title: The Outrageous Abuses Of The Fed
---
The Federal Reserve, along with every other central bank, is powerless to ignite an economy.
<!--more-->
It is peopled by arrogant, second and third-rate economists who have no idea what makes an economy run. <br />
They have singularly failed to predict any important financial and/or economic development. <br />
We examine what they have done and why it could never have worked. <br />
Yellen is just more of the same. <br />
Is the Fed really going to buy every single asset on the face of the earth â€“ to prevent it going down in value? <br />
What utter morons! <br />
A speaker explains why the government can never cut spending. <br />
Stock market comment. <br />
Unemployment comment. <br />
The misery index. <br />
Dollar comment. <br />
The future of war in the developed world.
