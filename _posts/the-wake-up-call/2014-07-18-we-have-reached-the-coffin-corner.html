title: We Have Reached The Coffin Corner
---
First of all, a comparison between the way things were just before the First World War and now.
<!--more-->
The parallels are striking and scary. <br />
The definition and causes of ‘slowing growth’. <br />
We are moving towards ‘the coffin corner’ (pictured here) where the economic availability of the economy is simply insufficient to service the debt. <br />
That, right there, is the endgame. <br />
Global M&amp;A volume is slowing sharply. <br />
This will cause further massive waves of layoffs to come. <br />
Listen to Elizabeth Warren  destroy the credibility of Janet Yellen in Congress. <br />
Donald Trump’s view of the economy. <br />
Yet more evidence of a slowing worldwide economy.
