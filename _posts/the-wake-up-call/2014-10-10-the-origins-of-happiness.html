title: The Origins Of Happiness

Does economic progress automatically increase happiness?
<!--more-->
There are ugly studies which show that current levels of happiness are far below those of bygone eras. <br />
But no definitive studies have been made in this regard. <br />
Material comforts seem to lead to social disintegration and spiritual emptiness. <br />
Who can pinpoint the era which enjoyed the highest level of happiness? <br />
Increased populations do not necessarily encourage closer friendships: they often lead to increased loneliness. <br />
Evolution has no interest in happiness. <br />
It is only interested in survival and reproduction. <br />
Recreational drugs are a kind of pathetic way to find happiness. <br />
How well do they work?<br />
Â  Dentists seem to have the answer to where the economy is headed. <br />
Listen to Jim Rickards talking about deflation and the depression. <br />
A look at where the economy would be if unnecessary regulations were removed and by how much GDP would consequently increase. <br />
The figures are quite sobering.
