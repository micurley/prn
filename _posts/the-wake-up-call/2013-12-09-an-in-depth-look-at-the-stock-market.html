The market continues to rise solely on the perception that the Fed’s easy money policy can hold stock prices up<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
indefinitely.  Mind you, this is just a perception, nothing more.<br />
 This line of thinking will prove to be no more durable than the dot-com bubble that peaked in early 2000 or the housing bubble that topped out in late 2007. <br />
Most of the previous major market peaks occurred with the P/E ratio ranging between 18 and 21 times reported cyclically-smoothed GAAP earnings, compared to a norm of 15 times and bear market lows between 7 and 10 times. <br />
The current P/E ratio is 20.<br />
6 times earnings. <br />
Optimism reigns supreme and an overwhelming number of technical indicators are calling for a massive decline here. <br />
Investment advisers were more bearish than in 25 years. <br />
The madness of the Fed’s $3.<br />
2 trillion negative balance sheet. <br />
They are truly insane. <br />
I mean that. <br />
More on last week’s monthly unemployment figures. <br />
The current state of the economy in two minutes. <br />
The latest ramping-up of consumer credit/debt. <br />
Hurricanes and global warming and other nonsense. <br />
Chimpanzees filmed exhibiting jealousy! <br />
(A lesson for us all).<br />
