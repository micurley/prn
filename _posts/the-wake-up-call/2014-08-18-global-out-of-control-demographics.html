There is much to be learned about this from Aldous Huxley and we hear several quotes from his ‘Brave New World<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

(Revisited)’. <br />
Many awkward questions, not many answers. <br />
An in-depth look at population statistics and the true motives behind wars. <br />
A look at ‘Abenomics’ (the economics of the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe). <br />
More on GDP. <br />
The inability of average citizens to prevail when it comes to public policy. <br />
Car buying in America and its corresponding auto loan industry (currently sporting the ever-popular ‘sub-prime’ version). <br />
Another catastrophe waiting to happen, just like the sub-prime lending equivalent with the housing market. <br />
Will we never learn?
