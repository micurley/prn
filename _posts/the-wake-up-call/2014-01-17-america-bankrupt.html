serious action. <br />
But most Americans are too willfully ignorant and/or intimidated by the size and scope of the problem to demand major changes to the irresponsible way the government does business. <br />
Without the American people insisting that Congress move, it remains so intent on increasing spending that it wouldn’t be behaving any other way if their goal had been to create a debt-driven economic collapse. <br />
And if the country’s not bankrupt, how do you justify the concept of injecting more of the disease (ie debt) to the already-existing disease itself (yes, debt) hoping to cure the disease. <br />
Where’s the non-bankruptcy in all that? <br />
The US is facing a serious shortage of scientists (science, technology, engineering and math: STEM, for short). <br />

  7 democrats are trying to pressure the media into giving more airtime to global warming. <br />
Global temperatures have been cooling for 17 years and, according to a Russian scientist we could be looking at a new cooling period staring this year. <br />
Ben Bernanke indulges in a final orgy of self-congratulation to “demolish the skeptics”. <br />
Poor, misguided fool. <br />
You can go home now, Benny-boy! <br />
Drunk judge in Florida faces no legal consequences…<br />
