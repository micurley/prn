And, yes, John Kerry really did utter the quote above. Michio Kaku discusses education in America.

An in-depth look into why and how Americans are stupid. <br />
Willful ignorance, arrogant cluelessness, self-satisfied obliviousness… all represent the state of unawareness with which Americans lead their lives. <br />
Studied indifference to the world outside is the only explanation for why Congress gets away with so much fraud and intellectual sloth. <br />
And the media are entirely complicit. <br />
The horrendous ignorance surrounding social security has allowed politicians – especially presidents – to ride roughshod over the finances, stealing money and pretending there was a surplus, using the false accounts and then declaring that there was room for tax cuts! <br />
Americans never said a word… More on the US ‘pivot’ towards Asia. <br />
The case of Germany, seemingly so prosperous but careening towards serious trouble with aging demographics will hurt more and more over the next two decades.<br />
