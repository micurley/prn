title: Nicole Foss Of The Automatic Earth Gives An Appraisal
---


A long but very incisive interview with the head of The Automatic Earth blog site. I agree with everything she says.
<!--more-->
A far-reaching survey of her opinions on many matters pertaining to the future. <br />
This is a first for me – the longest interview the Wake-Up Call has ever transmitted. <br />
Well worth your while. <br />
A brief comment (from me) on America’s decision to ‘kick the can down the road’ on the debt ceiling and related issues. <br />
A truly pathetic spectacle. <br />
Update on the TPP. <br />
Inequality in America. <br />
The coming union of the largest European banks in 2014. <br />
Comment from David Stockman. <br />
Anecdotal story about a drunken sheriff’s deputy trying to arrest a female soldier for not reciprocating his advances!<br />
