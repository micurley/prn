My theme for 2014.
<!--more-->
I describe the historical underpinnings and the inevitable war as a resentful United States attacks China in a futile attempt to contain it, precisely mirroring Britain’s attack on Germany twice in the twentieth century. <br />
It is not a matter of ‘whether’. <br />
It is a question of ‘when’. <br />
Current policies are and have been based on a total suspension of consequences for making the wrong decisions. <br />
We are about to face those consequences. <br />
They cover the entire spectrum of social demographics: from the government  through to the population-at -large: from the richest of the very rich to the poorest beggar on the streets. <br />
The consequences will be felt by all.
<br />
