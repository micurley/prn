Quick comment on the government shut-down and debt ceiling fiasco.
<!--more-->
We are witnessing what David Stockman calls the failure of the American state itself. <br />
It is careening wildly into dysfunction and incontinence. <br />
Vast sums of money transferred from the have-nots to the haves. <br />
The greatest heist of all time. <br />
The Federal Reserve is behind it all. <br />
There is no good reason for this and no possible positive outcome for the country. <br />
I describe in graphic detail the scandalous ‘money-drops’ to favored institutions and financial organizations and the so-called “reasoning” behind the fund movements. <br />
Why is the Prime Minister of Malaysia critical of the TPP but America seems to take it lying down? <br />
Both countries are equally disadvantaged by this so-called “trade agreement” which is nothing of the sort. <br />
Third quarter earnings reporting season has just begun and the results are grim. <br />
Beggars now need permits in Middle Township, NJ. <br />
Failure to possess one will incur the unfortunate beggar in a $250 fine. <br />
How delightfully humane! <br />
The Defense Department is ordering hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of equipment it doesn’t need. <br />
We all know why (don’t we?<br />
).
