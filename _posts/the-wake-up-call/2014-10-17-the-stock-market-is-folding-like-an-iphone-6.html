The government’s and the media’s desperate efforts to paint lipstick on pigs.
<!--more-->
They claim consumer spending will save the day, conveniently forgetting that the “consumer”has neither money, assets nor borrowing power. <br />
This does not stop the powers-that-be trying to coax them into spending money they do not have on things they can ill-afford. <br />
These monsters are the drug-equivalent of enablers on steroids. <br />
They lie through their teeth and there’s not a damned thing you can do about it (except leave!<br />
) The current AIG trial. <br />
Well, well worth reading the transcript. <br />
It reads like a detective story. <br />
You get a fascinating insight into the mindsets of these government crooks. <br />
Houston has issued subpoenas demanding pastors turn over any sermons dealing with homosexuality, gender identity or the mayor, lesbian, Annise Parker. <br />

This just might not have happened if they’d been living in, say, Malaysia or Costa Rica. <br />
America creates its own enemies which is bound to have significant negative effects everywhere. <br />
Support for Nigel Farage’s UKIP party in the UK is surging. <br />
Starbucks baristas have been forbidden to write the names of its customers on its polystyrene cups at a branch near the CIA. <br />
(Could be outing an agent, you see…)
