title: Stick With The United States Dollar!
---
Don’t confuse a country’s economic prospects with those of its currency.
<!--more-->
The dollar remains the principal currency of world trade and will remain that way for some time to come. <br />
The US has plenty of trade to support a viable dollar. <br />
Other currencies do not have the volume of the US dollar. <br />
The next-in-line, China’s remnimbi (yuan) is in crisis right now and it will be many years before the yuan is in a satisfactory position to assume world leadership. <br />
China has announced a three-day suspension of domestic money transfers and a nine-day suspension of foreign transfers. <br />
We are not clear why. <br />
More on the bursting of the global currency bubble. <br />
Quick stock market comment. <br />
The total failure of Keynesian economics. <br />
The grim way Americans view each other. <br />
More police outrages against innocent citizens.
