title: Looking In Vain For An Economic Recovery
---
It is truly extraordinary: despite the trillions of dollars thrown at the economy there is no inflation.
<!--more-->
Money is not the answer. <br />
Money leads to debt and debt leas to ruin. <br />
The government has learned nothing over the last thirty years. <br />
The supreme arrogance of Bernanke, who decided he in his infinite wisdom “understood” the great depression, is bringing the country to its knees. <br />
Fraud, stupidity, malinvestment, overindebtedness, all have conspired to lay waste the economy for generations to come.
<br />
A quick comment on the stock market. <br />
Overvalued, overbought and maximum bullish – a poor mix for continued gains. <br />
IPOs galore. <br />
Stock buybacks aplenty. <br />
Gurus uniformly bullish and coming on TV, talking up the market. <br />
And the economy continues to contract. <br />
The top cannot be far off. <br />
Voters very negative on the economy. <br />
More on police brutality. <br />
Banks hiding their losses, courtesy of the government green light. <br />
Almost half of all corporate bonds rated by S&amp;P are “speculative” (a polite word for junk).<br />
