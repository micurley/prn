The process by which the point-of-no-return (the point at which the gravitational pull in physics becomes so great that<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
nothing can escape) causes the great financial unraveling to take place. <br />
This is called the singularity. <br />
In financial and economic terms we have reached singularity by way of the famed ‘black hole’ which sucks everything into it. <br />
The collapse of the economic bubble creates its own black hole which will not respond to any stimulus measures. <br />
As the Fed goons slowly arrive at this realization and understanding, the horror will become absolutely apparent in Yellen’s demeanor when she talks publicly. <br />
Watch for it. <br />
It will be unmistakable. <br />
More on the media. <br />
(Apologies!<br />
) Interesting statistics which show that even the public is tiring of their lies and hype. <br />
The Fed stress tests. <br />
The financial system is truly shakier than ever. <br />
10% of the European banks have failed their own stress tests. <br />
More on deleveraging and deflation and how they will play themselves out. <br />
The vulnerability of the financial system, a pyramid of debt and credit that could – and will – fall apart at any time. <br />
The story of Amazon which has never made a profit at any time since it was created. <br />
Yet the stock is trading near $300/share! <br />
(Don’t look at me.)
