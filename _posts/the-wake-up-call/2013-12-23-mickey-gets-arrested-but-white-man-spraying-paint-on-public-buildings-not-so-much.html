An ex-assistant DA tries to get arrested so as to witness the seamier side of American Justice.
<!--more-->
He finds it impossible to get himself arrested and finally has to turn himself in. <br />
Then we see what life is like in prison. <br />
(Grim beyond measure). <br />
We also hear about the absurd goings-on by the morons in the court room. <br />
How the middle class has been dismantled in ten years. <br />
The non-recovery recovery. <br />
Is the US bankrupt? <br />
You decide. <br />
The stock market report. <br />
The CIA is withholding a 6,000-page report on its foul acts that we have come to know about in recent years. <br />
The Obama administration has bowed to pressure to keep it secret. <br />
Few citizens believe their children’s lives will be better than their own. <br />
We do not need a banking sector in the traditional sense anymore. <br />
Automation has amply replaced most clerical functions but the banking parasites benefit immensely from the banks’ skimming machine.<br />
