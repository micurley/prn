QE (”quantitative easing”) or money-printing is over.
<!--more-->
The evidence comes from Japan but is being admitted almost openly in US financial circles. <br />
An abject failure. <br />
A terrible experiment gone awry. <br />
And its demented creator scurries around the country picking up $75,000 to $250,000 fees for “lecturing” the country. <br />
Listen to a scathing critique from William White, ex-chief economist for the BIS, the central bank of central banks. <br />
“Freedom” in the US is now relative. <br />
Innocent until proven guilty? <br />
Not so much. <br />
Janet Yellen thinks “full employment” is just around the corner. <br />
Poor, misguided moron. <br />
More on Europe’s problems. <br />
Utter disillusionment about the political process on the part of the American public.<br />
The art of forecasting. <br />
Family Dollar and Coldwater Creek bite the dust.
