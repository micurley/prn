---
The horrors of American healthcare laid bare. The ‘rationale’ for the high prices. Doctors’ incentives.
<!--more-->
The history of American health ‘insurance’. <br />
The appalling scandal of medical errors which kill between 210,000 and 440,000 patients each year. <br />
Medical ‘culture’. <br />
Transportation has its Safety Board. <br />
Why not medicine? <br />
Overprescribing. <br />
Obamacare doesn’t even pretend to cover the entire population. <br />
More on unemployment. <br />
(The percentage of Americans looking for work or working is the lowest in36 years). <br />
One lie after another from the government and its mouthpiece, the main stream media. <br />
Several statistics bring the point home. <br />
According to a major new study, people who avoid carbohydrates and eat more fat, even saturated fat, lose more body fat and have fewer cardiovascular risks than people who follow the low-fat diet that health authorities have favored for decades. <br />
The Chinese economy is about to implode. <br />
You heard it here first!<br />
  Their financial system is also almost certain to face a fully-blown banking crisis.
<br />
