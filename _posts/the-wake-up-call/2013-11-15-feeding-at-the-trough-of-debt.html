title: Feeding At The Trough Of Debt
---
A study of who is indebted to who, where the money comes from, when this nightmare started, how and why.
<!--more-->
The situation before debt was issued via credit cards and the situation today and how it is perverting the country and killing the middle class. <br />
Mindless, idiotic, desperate loans still being made via the subprime route. <br />
The day or reckoning lies ahead. <br />
Don’t even ask.<br />
  Confessions of a Fed whistleblower, maybe the first. <br />
Very instructive and not-to-be-missed. <br />
Pure evidence that Bernanke is a villain working in secret for the moneyed interests. <br />
Does the man even have a conscience? <br />
Comparing the US to the UK Where’s the growth? <br />
Retailers now opening on Thanksgiving Day in the morning. <br />
Another sign of the desperation among businesses everywhere and in all sectors of the economy.
