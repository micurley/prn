title: The Economic Recovery Fraud
---
Plenty of statistics here proving incontestably that there is not and has not been any economic recovery.
<!--more-->
The heist executed by Bernanke and Hank Paulson in 2008 was the greatest theft ever carried out by humanity. <br />
It is impossible to fathom the stupidity of Congress in falling for the scam. <br />
They actually rejected the first bill that was presented to them but succumbed a few days later when it was represented with a few mild alterations. <br />
The laughable jobs recovery touted by Obama and his sycophantic minions, paid-off economist shills and the discredited corporate media can easily be viewed in graphic form as the false story-line it is. <br />
Stock market update. <br />
Falsely contived earnings, artificially-inspired future projections, Fed-manipulated inflated asset prices, debts piling on again. <br />
What a rotten system! <br />
The virtues of deflation.
