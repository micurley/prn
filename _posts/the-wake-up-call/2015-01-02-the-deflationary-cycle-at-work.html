2015 will be an exceptionally difficult year. A word on why commodity prices have been collapsing (deflation).
<!--more-->
The bubble that preceded the collapse was responsible. <br />
A painstaking look at several commodities to see how their prices were mercilessly bid up by greedy financiers. <br />
China played an overwhelmingly large part in all this with its mad scramble to become the worldâ€™s export factory. <br />
But given that their massive works projects were a one-time affair, what are they going to do for an encore? <br />
How will they unwind their massive debts? <br />
Economic war precedes military conflict. <br />
No example of economic war supersedes what we see worldwide today. <br />
That is why military conflict is certain. <br />
A quick word on housing and how it relates to shale production. <br />
A word on why the entire expansion meme is a phony bunch of nonsense. <br />
The whole thing is debt-based. <br />
Without the infusion of debt there would have been no expansion at all over the last thirty years!
