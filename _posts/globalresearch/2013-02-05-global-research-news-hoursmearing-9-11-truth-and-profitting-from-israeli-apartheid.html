title: Global Research News HourSmearing 9/11 Truth and Profitting from Israeli Apartheid
---
First, a conversation with Winnipeg based journalist Lesley Hughes.
<!--more-->
A journalist who ran for the Liberal Party of Canada as one of their star candidates in the 2008 election was turfed and smeared as an anti-semitic conspiracy theorist. <br />
This was after an old article of hers came to light seriously questioning the official story of the September 11 terrorist attacks. <br />
 Later on, Richard Sanders of the Coalition Opposed to the Arms Trade shares his research about the extent to which Canadians unwillingly and unknowingly benefit from pension funds invested in the Israeli military and security appartus. <br />
We end the show with Stephen Lendman explaining the dangerous result of the last Israeli elections.
