Outlawing Natural Health, The Fracking Bubble, The Life and Death of Hugo Chavez
Imagine a middle-aged couple starting<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
a simple business. <br />
They provide herbs or vitamins or some other innocuous product to the public. <br />
Let’s suppose they also promote the health benefits of taking this product.
<br />
Under current laws, the couple could find themselves the target of a sting operation in which an armed RCMP SWAT team might swoop down on their residence, bust their door down, stick guns in the occupants’ faces and force them to sit on a couch for eleven hours while the agents search for contraband.
<br />
According to constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati, not only could this happen, it has happened! <br />
In Canada!
<br />
The offensive legislation in question relates to an Act that governs so-called Natural Health Products. <br />
Dietary supplements, vitamins, herbs, foods and any other such natural item have proven to be far less dangerous than most over the counter prescription medications. <br />
These are now being targeted by Health Canada as a potential health hazard.
<br />
Galati is mounting a legal challenge against Health Canada. <br />
He tells the Global Research News Hour why the legislation on the books is insidious and unconstitutional and needs to be changed.
<br />
The Fracking Bubble
According to Deborah Rodgers of Energy Policy Forum, the current boom in shale oil and gas is not only unsustainable and environmentally contentious, it is built on unreliable estimates and projections. <br />
In this interview she explains the critical difference between reserve estimates and resource estimates, and why Wall Street is deriving profits from what appears to be a bubble akin to the Sub Prime Mortgage bubble which burst in 2008.
<br />
The Death of Chavez
Millions around the world are mourning the death of Bolivarian leader Hugo Chavez who died of cancer on Tuesday March 5 at the age of 58. <br />
Chavez defied US imperial aims including a coup attempt in 2002. <br />
He has since been a thorn in the side of both the Bush and the Obama administrations.
<br />
As the Venezuelan people grieve and admirers around the world pay homage, the Global Research News Hour brings in frequent guest and Chavez admirer Stephen Lendman to examine Chavez’s impact on international geo-politics. <br />
We also discuss the possibility that the Venezuelan President may have been the victim of a US assassination attempt!
