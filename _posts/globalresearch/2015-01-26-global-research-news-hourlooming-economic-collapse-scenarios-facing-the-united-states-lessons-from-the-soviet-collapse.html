 On the Global Research News Hour this week, we spend the hour discussing the looming collapse scenarios facing the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
United States with Russian-American engineer Dmitry Orlov.
<br />
Orlov’s perspective on collapse is informed by his extended trips to his former homeland before and during its collapse.
<br />
Orlov believes and states that the former Soviet Union was set up to be resilient in the face of collapse. <br />
This, he believes is not the case in the US or Canada.
<br />
In this interview, Orlov also comments on the current situation with low oil prices, peak oil and its impact on agriculture, Russian moves in alignment with China, overtures toward the EU, the politics of austerity, the Ukraine Civil War as Anglo-Imperialist Departure Strategy, and much more.
<br />
Dmitry Orlov has written two books, Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Experience and American Prospects as well as the Five Stages of Collapse: Survivors’ Toolkit. <br />
Mr Orlov is also the author of the blog cluborlov.com and is a much sought after geo-political analyst.<br />
