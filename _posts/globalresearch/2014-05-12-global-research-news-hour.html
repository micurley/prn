Egyptian Death Sentences: Human Rights Travesty or Price of Freedom?
<!--more-->
In recent weeks, the governing authority in Egypt has escalated their crackdown on supporters of deposed president Mohammad Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.
<br />
In March, news agencies widely reported that after a two day trial, 529 people, many of whom were tried in absentia, were sentenced to death over an attack on a police station in which a police officer was killed. <br />
[2]
In late April, 683 alleged supporters of the Brotherhood, including spiritual leader Mohammed Badie were sentenced to death over their supposed role in the August 14 incident. <br />
[3]
Likewise, the Egyptian courts have banned the April 6 movement, considered a pro-democracy group which played a role in instigating and organizing the Arab Spring movement which overthrew President Mubarak in 2011. <br />
[4] Numerous journalists have been jailed as well under the rationale that they are “spreading false news” and “part of a terrorist organisation.<br />
”[5]
This week’s Global Research News Hour examines two perspectives on the repressive measures being taken by the Egyptian military government against the Muslim Brotherhood, the April 6 movement, and other critics of the current authorities.
<br />
Film Maker John Greyson was one of two Canadians who got caught up in last summer’s mass arrests. <br />
After fifty days of detention without charge, he and his companion Tarek Loubani were released. <br />
[6] Greyson spoke to the Global Research News Hour about his harrowing ordeal, the conditions he and other prisoners faced, and about the need to intervene on behalf of other innocents being wrongfully held.
<br />
A geo-political analyst and frequent Global Research contributor who goes by the name Tony Cartalucci has a different perspective. <br />
He believes the repressive actions being taken by the military government and the courts need to be seen in the context of an ongoing foreign orchestrated insurgency not dissimilar to those that led Libya and Syria to disaster. <br />
Cartalucci engaged the Global Research News Hour in an email interview which is reprinted below in its entirety.
<br />
The email dialogue was voiced, for radio purposes, by Global Research guest host Jon Wilson and regular host Michael Welch.
