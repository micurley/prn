A Speech by Guy Mcpherson.

The Global Research News Hour Episode 70

This week’s Global Research News Hour features a speech given by scientist and ‘doomer’ author Guy Mcpherson.
<br />
While much of the public may have doubts about whether or not anthropogenic climate change is a reality, it is a FACT that over 97% of peer-reviewed scientific research published over the last two decades confirm the viewpoint that the planet is indeed warming due to human activities.
<br />
As noted in a previous interview, Dr Mcpherson, Professor Emeritus of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Arizona, has spent countless hours pouring over the scientific literature, and connected numerous dots. <br />
Dr Mcpherson is in full agreement with the scientific concensus around anthropogenic (human-generated) climate change. <br />
Further, he concludes that global warming has passed a “tipping point” and that habitat loss associated with the warming of the planet will condemn the human species to extinction within 20 years.
<br />
Unlike other prominent scientists and activists, Mcpherson concludes that there is really nothing the human species can do to prevent or mitigate this catastrophe.
<br />
Dr McPherson has given many lectures to public audiences across Canada and the United States and has now done multiple media interviews. <br />
His February 6 speech in Winnipeg laid out the evidence in detail. <br />
Winnipeg audience members had a chance to direct questions to the American speaker afterward. <br />
The talk was introduced by his host, Gerry Kopelow of the Dharma Centre of Winnipeg.
<br />
Guy McPherson is the author of Going Dark. <br />
