“Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat.
<!--more-->
We cannot erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. <br />
That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. <br />
That’s why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. <br />
At this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. <br />
And one of those groups is ISIL — which calls itself the “Islamic State.<br />
”
-US President Barrack Obama from his September 10 speech to the nation. <br />

Thirteen years after September 11, 2001,  the 9/11 Truth movement has become a major phenomenon.
<br />
There are now over 2,250 professional architects and engineers who have acknowledged flaws in the official explanation of what caused the World Trade Center Towers to collapse.
<br />
A poll from last year found that nearly 50% of Americans exposed to footage of the collapsing World Trade Center Towers suspect they were brought down by controlled demolition.
<br />
Two years ago, the documentary “9/11: Explosive Evidence – Experts Speak Out” aired on PBS and ranked among the top three most watched programs on the station, and the most shared on the internet.<br />
[2]
On September 8, 2013, the popular Russia Today broadcast, The Truth Seeker, aired a thirteen minute newscast critical of the official explanation of 9/11. <br />
The broadcast was starting to go viral on You Tube before Youtube statistics suspiciously flat-lined.<br />
[3]
The 9/11 Truth movement is becoming increasingly visible as RETHINK 911 anniversary events in New York City and around the world are becoming increasingly impossible to ignore.
<br />
Meanwhile, US President Barrack Obama on the eve of the anniversary announces his plans to launch military assaults in Iraq and Syria in order to destroy the terrorist menace with virtually no significant resistance.
<br />
The 9/11 Consensus Panel put out a press release in recent days announcing new points of concensus relating to the 9/11 airliner black boxes found at the World Trade Center site, standard protocols that were not followed in the instance of a hijacking, and incriminating statements from former New York City Mayor Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
<br />
The Truth movement may be growing, but there seems to be no noticeable changes in the political landscape as a result.
<br />
On the week marking the thirteenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we get thirteenth anniversary retrospectives on 9/11 from two people very much at the forefront of the efforts to challenge the official account of the tragedy. <br />
They address the efforts to investigate 9/11 using recently revealed but rarely seen on-line documents, the obstacles to 9/11 Truth making a breakthrough in the political arena, the role of groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS/ISIL as US strategic assets, and concerns forming around a new State directed investigation.
<br />
Elizabeth Woodworth is a retired health Sciences Librarian and researcher. <br />
She is coordinator and co-founder of the 9/11 Concensus Panel.
<br />
Michel Chossudovsky is the Director and Founder of the Centre for Research On Globalization, an Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Ottawa and author of “America’s War On Terrorism.<br />
” He was one of the first people in the world to publicly question the 9/11 narrative, specifically the claim that it was necessary to wage a “War on Terrorism” in order to contain and control Al Qaeda.
<br />
A complete digest of 9/11 related articles is available on the Global Research site.
