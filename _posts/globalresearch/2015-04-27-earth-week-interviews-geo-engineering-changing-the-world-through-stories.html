the planet from environmental damage.
<br />
First, we hear from Michael J Murphy, director/producer of the films “What in the World are the Spraying” and “Why in the World are they Spraying”. <br />
He discusses the clear and present threats associated with Geo-Engineering including so-called ‘chemtrails’ and speculates on who benefits and who does not from efforts to control the weather.
<br />
Carrie Saxifrage is a sustainability reporter for the Vancouver Observer and the author of the book “The Big Swim: Coming Ashore in a World Adrift”. <br />
She discusses how popular action can more easily be mobilized by changing the narrative and the way we approach the dilemma of climate collapse and other environmental hazards.
