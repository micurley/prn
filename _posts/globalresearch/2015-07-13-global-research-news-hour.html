<!--more-->
of the Global Research News Hour (October 17, 2014) Global Research News Hour centres on the current military mobilization against the entity known as ISIL/ISIS. <br />
Can boots on the ground be avoided? <br />
Is there an ulterior motive to the bombing campaign related to regional control? <br />
What does ISIL/ISISâ€™s successful campaign for control of the Kurdish village of Kobani say about the sincerity of this latest War on Terrorism? <br />
This hour attempts to address these and other questions.
