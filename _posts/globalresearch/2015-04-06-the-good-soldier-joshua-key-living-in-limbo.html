Iraq War Deserter Joshua Key. <br />
The event was held at the University of Winnipeg on March 29, 2015. <br />
Michelle Robidoux of the War Resisters Support Campaign updated the audience on the actions taken against Americans in Canada who sought sanctuary from the Iraq War. <br />
She is followed by Joshua Keyâ€™ s legal representative. <br />
