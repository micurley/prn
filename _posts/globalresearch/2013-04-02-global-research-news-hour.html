Suppressing 9/11 Truth in the Mainstream Media, Demonizing the Messenger
“It’s easy to take an issue like the 9/11<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
truth movement and demonize it…that happened in the election of 2008. <br />
Even though at the time it was a rising tide and growing numbers of people… had actually rejected the official explanation and were actively looking at the evidence hoping to find out what really happened, even though that was happening, the Conservatives in that election chose to demonize those folks, and I guess I appeared to be one of them because I was willing to talk about it with respect.<br />
”
-Lesley Hughes
During the Canadian federal election of 2008, Lesley Hughes, overnight, went from the Liberal Party’s star candidate to a political liability.
<br />
An article Hughes wrote in 2002 entitled “Get the Truth” offered readers a contrarian viewpoint on the war in Afghanistan as retaliation for 9/11.
<br />
The anonymous blogger Black Rod, unearthed the article, conflated it into an anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracy theory, and circulated it throughout the on-line community and the mainstream press.
<br />
Liberal leader Stephan Dion, under pressure from B’Nai Brith, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and his political opponents, not to mention uncomfortable media scrutiny, removed the candidacy of Ms. <br />
Hughes without ever confronting her about it directly.
<br />
Hughes, humiliated, dropped off the media radar screen and spent the subsequent few months licking her wounds. <br />
She finally found herself a lawyer and launched a defamation suit against the above-named groups, as well as Conservative candidate Peter Kent, the entities she saw as most responsible for this disastrous blow to her reputation.
<br />
In December of last year, at the end of a four year ordeal, Hughes was finally cleared of all charges of anti-Semitism.
<br />
Who is Lesley Hughes?
<br />
Hughes is much more than the “earnest middle-aged mother and community activist” described by National Post columnist and author Jonathan Kay in his 9/11 Truth hit-piece “Among the Truthers.<br />
”
Lesley Hughes is a Winnipeg-based broadcast and print journalist.
<br />
In the province of Manitoba, she became a house-hold name as co-host of the popular morning program Information Radio, a CBC show she helmed for more than ten years.
<br />
Her prowess as an interviewer earned her the distinction of sitting in briefly for CBC icon Peter Gzowski on the nationally broadcast Morningside, earning her praise from executive producer Patsey Pehleman for being “fresh and different.<br />
”
Over the course of a career that has spanned more than three decades, Lesley has interviewed a multitude of global movers and shakers, including former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, humanitarian Mother Theresa, South African President Nelson Mandela, dissident intellectual Noam Chomsky, French President Francois Mitterand, and playwright Tennessee Williams to name just a few.
<br />
She has since contributed articles to major newspapers. <br />
She covered the 1992 Earth Summit from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil for the Globe and Mail. <br />
She reported from the World Poverty Summit in Copenhagen, and the Information Summit in Geneva. <br />
She has authored book reviews for the Winnipeg Free Press. <br />
She continues to write the back column for the distinguished Canadian organ of progressive political thought known as Canadian Dimension Magazine.
<br />
Hughes has had her work carried by Radio Denmark, Radio Antilles and the Grenadian Voice.
<br />
Hughes has been a media trainer, instructing students at the University of Winnipeg. <br />
She was designated as the University of Manitoba’s Outstanding Alumnus for Distinguished Achievement, named one of Canada’s top three columnists for a weekly community newspaper by the Canadian Community Newspaper Association, and honoured Manitoba’s Woman of the Year in Communications and Best Interviewer (Radio) by Winnipeg ACTRA among other accolades.
<br />
The recent court ruling has affirmed what informed people, supporters and detractors alike, know all too well. <br />
Lesley Hughes has not an anti-Semitic bone in her body!
<br />
Lesley Hughes, regardless of what one might think of her politics, is an inspirational, compassionate, hard-working, brilliant and breath-takingly decent human being. <br />
It is a sad commentary on the times we live in that she could be brought down from her well-earned pedestal in Canadian life, simply for…well…doing her job as a journalist.
<br />
In this exclusive interview for the Global Research News Hour, Lesley Hughes from the living room of her Winnipeg home explains how she was affected personally and professionally by the allegations, her take on the corrosive effect of anonymous blogging on journalism, and about how attacks on 9/11 skeptics signals a new kind of McCarthyism.
<br />
She also introduces her upcoming memoir, “Hit and Run: My Brilliant Life in Canadian Politics.”
Also featured in this one hour programme is an interview with Richard Sanders of the Coalition Opposed to the Arms Trade, (coat.ncf.<br />
ca) about how Canadian Pension Plan investments are aiding and abetting Israeli War Crimes. <br />
We also hear an assessment of the recent Israeli elections by Chicago based writer and broadcaster Stephen Lendman.
