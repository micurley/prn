title: 'Student Debt Trap: Breaking the Grip of the Predatory Lenders'
---
In the month of February, fifteen former students of the for- profit Corinthian Colleges System declared they would no<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

longer be paying off their sizable federal student loans. <br />
They see the Corinthian system as corrupt, making false promises and part of a predatory leding racket. <br />
This action sets the stage for a conversation about the Student debt crisis and the nature of money.<br />
Ellen Brown author, former civil litigation attorney and founder of the Public Banking Institute comes on in the first half hour. <br />
She explains how student debt is not only crippling the debt holders with unfair debt repyment obligations, it is used by money managers as a commodity not unlike the Subprime mortgages that infamously led to the financial meltdown of 2008.<br />
Â In the second half hour we hear a September 2011 speech given by San Francisco Bay Area-basedIndependent journalist and podcast producer Kellia Ramares-Watson. <br />
She goes further than Ellen BRown in suggesting that the money system not only has to be reformed but disbanded altogether. <br />
She suggests in the speech that students should default on their debts as a political action.
