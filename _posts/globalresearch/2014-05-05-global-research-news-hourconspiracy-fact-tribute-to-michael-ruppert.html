title: 'Global Research News HourConspiracy Fact: Tribute to Michael Ruppert'
---
On April 13, 2014, Michael Ruppert had just completed his final broadcast of his weekly radio show The Lifeboat Hour,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
which he has helmed since September 12, 2010. <br />
He went to an outdoor meditation spot on the property at which he had been residing. <br />
When he was found, he had apparently shot himself in the head with a Glock 30 .45 caliber pistol.<br />
  He was 63.
<br />
Mike Ruppert had become one of the most outspoken and compelling voices in the realm of independent journalism and analysis. <br />
He brought to the table a stupendous command of economic, historical and political issues.
<br />
Ruppert represented a convergence of valuable traits which included an academic’s restless intellect, a cop’s eye for detail, a heart-felt passion for justice, and the street-level experience of a whistleblower who broke ranks with the people he trusted in the name of an all too uncommon ethical code that he lived by.
<br />
He was able to bring to the table the critical arguments challenging official government narratives about the global economy, the 9/11 attacks, the fratricidal death of Pat Tillman, CIA drug dealing in Black communities throughout the US, peak oil as a causative factor underlying US foreign policy, and many, many other stories.
<br />
This week, the Global Research News Hour pays tribute to Mr Ruppert on the occasion of his recent tragic death.
<br />
The podcast contains audio from past speeches and a previously recorded conversation with him, as well as post-mortem conversations with five individuals who knew and worked with Mike Ruppert over the years.
<br />
Carolyn Baker is a long-time acquaintance of Mike Ruppert’s. <br />
She was an adjunct professor of history and psychology for 11 years and a psychotherapist in private practice for 17 years. <br />
She authored several books related to the concept of societal collapse. <br />
She contributed to Ruppert’s on-line newsletter From The Wilderness, and co-hosted his final radio broadcast before he died.
<br />
Kellia Ramares-Watson is an Oakland-based independent journalist and broadcaster. <br />
She was Bonnie Faulkner’s co-host on the very first broadcast of Guns and Butter for radio station KPFA back on October 12, 2001. <br />
This debut episode featured none other than Mike Ruppert with his initial impressions of the 9/11 attacks and the US role in failing to prevent the attacks. <br />
The transcript of that interview is available on the Global Research website.
<br />
Wesley Miller was Mike Ruppert’s attorney, executor and personal friend. <br />
He replaced Ruppert as CEO and President of COLLAPSENET, the on-line community portal for individuals and communities seeking to transition away from a dependence on fossil fuels and industrial civilization.
<br />
Barrie Zwicker is a long-time independent journalist and media critic. <br />
He became one of the first people in the world to publicly critique the official story of 9/11 on a national television broadcast. <br />
Barrie was largely for getting RUppert’s analysis of 9/11 aired on Canadian television and paid tribute to him in his 2006 book Towers of Deception: The Media Cover-up of 9/11.
<br />
Guy McPherson is Professor Emeritus of Natural Resources and Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona. <br />
He has appeared on Ruppert’s radio show a number of times pioneering his research pointing to the prospects for the Near Term Extinction of the human species due to climate change.
<br />
Ruppert’s work has appeared often over the years on the Global Research website. <br />
A link to some of those stories can be found here.
