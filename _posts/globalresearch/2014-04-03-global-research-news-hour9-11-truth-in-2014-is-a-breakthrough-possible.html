This website, among others have articulated the major problems with the official explanation of 9/11 since the day<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

after they happened.
<br />
These attacks have directly led to an agenda of increased military spending, surveillance, at least two wars of aggression (Afghanistan and Iraq) and a period of curtailed civil liberties in the name of protection from radical Islamic terrorists.
<br />
Amply documented, there are major problems with this narrative. <br />
The following humourous video encapsulates many of these anomalies.

A more detailed analysis is available through Global Research’s 9/11 Reader.
<br />
There has been a clear resistance to abandoning this core narrative. <br />
Take, for example, the refusal of Canadian Member of Parliament Paul Dewar to table a petition  in the House of Commons calling for a Canadian parliamentary review of the omissions and inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission report and of available forensic evidence. <br />
Mr Dewar says he doesn’t agree with the petition. <br />
That is not considered an acceptable rationale for not tabling a petition to Parliament. <br />

There is more to this kind of resistance than a lack of facts. Laurie Manwell is a Ph.<br />
D candidate at the University of Guelph and has published articles on psychological resistance to embracing alternative explanations of 9/11 and other so-called State Crimes Against Democracy. <br />
Her article, In Denial of Democracy: Social Psychological Implications for Public Discourse on State Crimes Against Democracy Post-9/11 appeared in the February 2010 edition of American Behavioural Scientist. <br />
Her thesis was the basis of her outstanding presentation at the Toronto Hearings on 9/11. <br />
An excerpt of this presentation airs in the first half hour of this week’s Global Research News Hour, courtesy of Press For Truth.
<br />
Architect and high profile 9/11 speaker Richard Gage, AIA joins us in the second half hour. <br />
He talks with guest interviewer Jon Wilson about his tour across Canada, and his view about the prospects of 9/11 making a powerful political breakthrough in this country.<br />
