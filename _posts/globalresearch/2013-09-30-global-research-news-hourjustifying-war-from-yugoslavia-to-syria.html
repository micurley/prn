Most human beings by nature are anti-war.
All military conflicts involve death and destruction, to say nothing of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

unintended consequences.
<br />
This is why for generations, military planners have made use of war pretext incidents to galvanize war-averse populations behind aggressive military actions against other countries.
<br />
These rationales are at core psychological operations utilizing justifications for military action generally not reflecting the government’s REAL reasons for going to war.
<br />
As researcher and anti-war campaigner Richard Sanders chronicles in his magazine Press For Conversion, war pretext incidents were involved in the Mexican-American War (1846), the Spanish-American War (1898), both World Wars, the Vietnam War (1964), the Wars against Iraq in 1991 and 2003, and NATO’s War Against Yugoslavia in 1999, among others.
<br />
Richard Sanders appears on this week’s Global Research News Hour to discuss this routine propaganda practice, and whether the August chemical attacks in a suburb of Damascus fit the pattern of standard war pre-text incidents.
<br />
In the final half hour of this week’s program, we hear two perspectives on one war pre-text in particular, that being the ‘Humanitarian Intervention.<br />
’
Lloyd Axworthy was the former Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister who authorized Canada’s military intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999 for humanitarian reasons. <br />
He recently co-authored a commentary in the Globe and Mail promoting a humanitarian intervention in Syria along the lines of the ‘Kosovo Model.<br />
’ The Global Research News Hour allowed Dr Axworthy, now the President of the University of Winnipeg, room to make his case.
<br />
Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, however, strenuously disagrees with Dr Axworthy’s viewpoint, arguing that the ‘Responsibility to Protect’ doctrine frequently results in worsening a situation from a humanitarian perspective. <br />
Nazemroaya is a geo-political analyst specializing in Middle East and Central Asia politics. <br />
He is a Research Associate with the Centre for Research on Globalization, and the award-winning author of The Globalization of NATO and The War on Libya and the Re-Colonization of Africa. <br />
Nazemroaya was in Libya in 2011, and witnessed NATO’s Humanitarian intervention there first hand.<br />
