Terrorists R Us: The Boston Mass Casualty Attack, Lockdown and High Profile Manhunt
“Those who would give up essential<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.<br />
”  – Benjamin Franklin, 1759
The mass casualty causing attack during the Boston Marathon, together with the high profile arrest of two men in Canada charged with plotting a terrorist attack on a commuter train have captivated the attention of regular citizens.
<br />
Fears have been ramped up to the point where Americans are tolerating if not welcoming martial law and erosions of civil liberties in the name of protection from the terrorist hordes.
<br />
Witness the high-profile man-hunt for bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev.
<br />
On April 19, the entire city of Boston was on lockdown. <br />
Residents told to lock themselves indoors while schools and businesses were closed while the entire transit system was shut down and SWAT teams took control of the streets.
<br />
The home of one of the most famous and iconic popular resistance actions in history, the Boston Tea Party, unquestioningly complied with authorities this time around – all in the name of capturing one wounded man.
<br />
Speaking of authorities, rigorous scrutiny of the authorities themselves may be in order.
<br />
Speaking to the Global Research News Hour in December, Andy Lee Roth, the Associate Director of Project Censored spoke of the fourth story in PC’s list of most censored stories of 2011-2012…
“…The FBI has a network of nearly 15,000 spies, moles and informants …whose job it is to infiltrate various communities within the United States, ostensibly to uncover terrorist plots …in many cases, those 15,000 spies, moles and informants are actually encouraging and then assisting the people in those communities in committing the very crimes that people are then busted for. <br />
So It’s a kind of set-up operation and it appears to be motivated by a desire on the FBI’s part to show that they are playing an effective role in the battle against terrorism on the home front.<br />
”
He further pointed out…
“This only works as a kind of PR strategy if the corporate media cooperate and basically take the government officials who speak on behalf of the program as the sole sources on the program’s efficacy.
<br />
What’s not covered in the corporate media but what can be documented in independent media coverage is that most of these cases when they go to court the judge throws them out for lack of merit.<br />
”
Without this context, the citizenry’s grasp of reality is imperiled. <br />
The common man and woman is left ripe for manipulation by powerful interests with another agenda entirely.
<br />
This, the twenty-fourth installment of the Global Research News Hour, sees independent broadcaster Stephen Lendman try to provide some of this context as the War On Terrorism gets its biggest PR boost in years and as tensions with Syria, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela are on the rise.
<br />
Stephen Lendman is the host of the Progressive Radio News Hour on the Progressive Radio Network, author of BANKER OCCUPATION: Waging Financial War on Humanity and a frequent contributor to globalresearch.<br />
