The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is being declared the deadliest on record, and certainly the first of its kind<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

in the region.
<br />
A recent report from the World Health Organization, a UN agency, found that there had been 2630 confirmed deaths directly attributable to the latest strain with 5,357 cases having been diagnosed. <br />
The disease is widespread and transmitting intensely throughout Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with additional cases emerging in Nigeria and Senegal.
<br />
The Global Research News Hour takes a closer look at the background of this developing situation with two observers with dissident takes on this new Clear and Present danger.
<br />
Aggressive measures are being taken.
<br />
US President Barrack Obama stated on Tuesday September 16 that his administration would be committing 3000 military personnel to help contain the spread of the epidemic in the region.
<br />
The World Bank is committing $200 million in assistance to the three hardest hit African countries.
<br />
And the micro-biologist who first identified the Ebola virus in 1976 is urging UK Prime Minister Cameron to take “quasi-military” measures to address the threat.
<br />
Authorities are preparing to fast-track the use 10,000 doses of an experimental, as yet untested Ebola vaccine for use in West Africa.
<br />
As of this writing, the President of the besieged State of Sierra Leone has ordered the residents of Freetown, its capital city, off the streets and into their homes, arguing  ”extraordinary times require extraordinary measures.<br />
”

The Global Research News Hour takes a closer look at the background of this developing situation with two observers with dissident takes on this new Clear and Present danger.
<br />
Jon Rappoport is the author of the blog NoMoreFakeNews.<br />
com. <br />
He has 30 years of experience as an investigative reporter and has authored three books including  The Matrix Revealed and  Exit from the Matrix.<br />
 He believes the World Health Organization, the Centres for Disease Control and other bodies are exaggerating the role of the Ebola virus in the death counts. <br />
 and speculates on how this new plague may be helping to advance a more cynical agenda.
<br />
Dr Leonard Horowitz is a Harvard-trained investigator and public health educator. <br />
He has authored more than ten books including the 1996 best-seller Emerging Viruses: Aids &amp; Ebola, Nature, Accident or Intentional. <br />
Dr Horowitz has argued for years that both Ebola and AIDS were bio-engineered in a laboratory. <br />
In this GR News Hour interview, he shares evidence of how the new outbreak constitutes commercial and scientific fraud, he talks about how his information is being suppressed by YouTube, Wikipedia and, of course, the corporate press, and he outlines what he believes is the real agenda behind this new War On Germs.<br />
