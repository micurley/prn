title: Omar Khadr, Guantanamo, and the “War On Terrorism”
---
 In the wake of the recently announced release on bail of Omar Khadr, the Global Research News Hour returns to the case<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
of the young man jailed in the notorious prison camp for nearly a decade.
<br />
In the first half hour, Khadr’s lawyer Dennis Edney expertly debunks many of the talking points being put forward by critics like the Conservative government and Ezra Levant about Khadr’s status as a “Confessed terrorist” and outlines the numerous ways in which the Canadian government violated Khadr’s Charter rights.
<br />
In the second half hour, Michel Chossudovsky expands on the Khadr tragedy by pointing to a Seymour Hersh article exposing the protection of Al Qaeda militants in theatre and the known incarceration of civilians at Guantanamo. <br />
Chossudovsky explains how the facility serves a propaganda function that enables the so-called “War on Terrorism.”
