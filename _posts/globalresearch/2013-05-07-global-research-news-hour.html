Aftermath of the Boston Bombings: The FBI, Canada and the Politics of Terror
“In terrorism stings, it’s really only the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
FBI that’s making it possible for people who otherwise couldn’t acquire weapons, who couldn’t build a bomb to move forward in an act of terrorism like we’re seeing in these sting operations. <br />
So, it’s really the FBI that’s making the crime possible in a way that they aren’t with traditional drug stings even though it’s very much the same type of tactic that they’re using today.<br />
”
-Trevor Aaronson
“At different points of time in history non-Anglo and Francophone Canadians and including Francophones during the independence movement in Quebec were terrorists… everybody’s been interned. <br />
Every group has been interned or labeled treasonous when it was convenient to do so.<br />
”
- Rocco Galati
Speculation and skepticism percolates through the World Wide Web with regard to the official narrative of the Boston Bombings.
<br />
On the day of the attacks, the FBI was placed in charge of the official investigation. <br />
[1]
To date, critical questions about the FBI’s role in these and other terrorist plots have yet to be addressed.
<br />
As documented on Global Research, the FBI has been caught deliberately lying about their actions and activities. <br />
[2]
Thoroughly documented, the FBI has been pivotal in the manufacture of several terrorist plots in the US. <br />
[3]
Trevor Aaronson’s pioneering work on the subject of FBI involvement in infiltrating and entrapping terrorist suspects made the cover of Mother Jones magazine in 2011 and became listed as one of the top 25 most censored stories of 2011-2012 by the media democracy organization Project Censored. <br />
This history is critical background in any sober analysis of the incident.
<br />
In Canada, the Conservative government invoked the Boston attacks to rush through legislation resurrecting previously sunsetted anti-terrorism provisions of preventative arrest and secret investigative hearings. <br />
By an amazing coincidence,  the same week the Canadian Parliament was debating the new anti-terrorism bill, the RCMP announced the arrest of two individuals implicated in a plot to attack a Via Rail passenger train. <br />
[4]
The RCMP said little about the evidence of their guilt though they helpfully volunteered the perpetrator’s links with Al Qaeda in Iran. <br />
Considering the enmity being expressed toward Iran by the US and Canada among other Western Countries, this tidbit interestingly parallels the innuendo of Iraq’s alleged links to terrorism in the lead up to the 2003 Iraq War.
<br />
In an effort to deconstruct the propaganda around the War on Terrorism’s biggest PR boost in years, the Global Research News Hour delves into the Boston Bombings and its aftermath.
<br />
In this week’s show, Trevor Aaronson, author of “The Terror Factory: Inside the FBI’s Manufactured War on Terrorism” examines the agency’s role of deliberately creating the plots they then disrupt. <br />
Aaronson’s analysis speaks to the FBI’s focus on marginalized individuals at the expense of real dangers.
<br />
Then, Canadian Constitutional Lawyer Rocco Galati trashes the recently passed Combating Terrorism Act as a completely unnecessary threat to civil liberties with consequences that go beyond Islamic extremism.
<br />
Finally, Global Research’s Julie Lévesque provides a much needed overview of the Boston Bombings legend and the critical questions the mainstream media should be asking but is not.
