title: 'Global Research News HourThe 1973 Chilean Military Coup: Remembering the Other
    September 11'
---
For much of the population, September 11 marks the anniversary of the infamous terrorist attacks on the World Trade<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Center and the Pentagon.
<br />
But for the people of Chile, much of Latin America, and democratic reformers at large, it marks another significant anniversary.
<br />
On the morning of September 11, 1973, all branches of the Chilean Armed Forces had conspired to wrest control of the country from democratically-elected leader Salvador Allende. <br />
Allende, having been tipped about the military’s activities, held his ground in his Presidential palace, La Moneda.
<br />
After Allende refused to negotiate or surrender, General Augusto Pinochet ordered a siege on the compound accompanied by military helicopter gunships and Air Force bombers. <br />
Salvador Allende died during the melee, apparently by his own hand, and a military junta took power headed by General Pinochet.
<br />
It is well documented that the US government, through the CIA, played a key role in the overthrow of the Allende government.
<br />
The new order in Chile saw massive economic reforms take effect. <br />
An alarming number of people were imprisoned and tortured under his rule. <br />
Over three thousand people are estimated to have been killed during Pinochet’s 17 year reign.
<br />
PInochet himself was eventually arrested in London in 1998, and faced with the unpleasant prospect of having to answer for his crimes.
<br />
The 40th anniversary of Chile’s 9/11 is an occasion to ask what have been the impacts of the coup, and the dictatorship that followed?
<br />
These questions are explored in depth by two people knowledgeable about the coup.
<br />
Michel Chossudovsky was a visiting Professor of Economics in Chile at the time of the coup. <br />
In this week’s radio show, Chossudovsky reflects on his memories of the coup, and looks at how it served as a dress-rehearsal for the use of macro-economic reform as a weapon for disarming governments worldwide.
<br />
Peter Kornbluh then recounts the US role in the affair. <br />
He is the author of The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability, recently updated to mark the 40th anniversary of the coup. <br />
Not only does he elaborate on the proof of the US connection with the coup, he explains his conviction that the arrest of Pinochet marks a major turning point in terms of holding past and present state criminals accountable.
