Some effort has been made to try to connect this tragedy with the Russian government. <br />
This latest event takes place in the context of significant military casualties by Ukrainian forces in the Donbass, increasing dispatches of Canadian and US troops to the region, and an intensifying demonizayion campaign of Russian President Putin. <br />
To help contextualize these events, the global Research News Hour is joined by two editors of the website newcoldwar.<br />
org, a site which attempts to expose the truht about the Ukraine situation.
