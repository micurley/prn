title: The UN Climate Conference, “False Solutions” and the Climate Conundrum

 “Followers of climate science will recall COP15 as the climate-change meetings thrown under the bus by the Obama<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

administration. <br />
A summary of that long-forgotten briefing begins with this statement:
‘THE LONG-TERM SEA LEVEL THAT CORRESPONDS TO CURRENT CO2 CONCENTRATION IS ABOUT 23 METERS ABOVE TODAY’S LEVELS, AND THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE 6 DEGREES C OR MORE HIGHER. <br />
THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON REAL LONG TERM CLIMATE RECORDS, NOT ON MODELS.’
“In other words, Obama and others in his administration knew near-term extinction of humans was already guaranteed.<br />
” -Guy McPherson, from the 2013 book Going Dark
On the occasion of the UN Climate Conference in Lima, Peru, this week’s Global Research News Hour examines the latest research into the causes of Earth’s current Climate predicament.
<br />
 Guy McPherson is emeritus Professor of natural resources and the environment at the University of Arizona, He is the author of about a dozen books including Going Dark and his most recent, Extinction Dialogs: How to Live with Death in Mind.<br />
’ co-authored by Carolyn Baker. <br />
Guy is the author of the Nature Bats Last blog at www.guymcpherson.com.<br />
 
Professor McPherson believes that there is virtually nothing humans can do to reverse the damage done by modern industrial civilization and that humans will likely become extinct as a result of runaway Climate change by the middle of the twenty-first century.
<br />
Professor McPherson explains his thesis of Near Term Human Extinction, the need to come to terms with the grief that goes along with that realization, the problems with geo-engineering as a remedy, and the problematic behaviour of both political leaders and mainstream environmental organizations in the face of the Climate Predicament.<br />
