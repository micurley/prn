        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Brian Hooker, the man at the center of the CDC vaccination scandal
---
Brian Hooker is the man to which CDC whistleblower William Thompson confessed his sins, such as manipulating the data<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

from an MMR vaccine study to eliminate the association between autism and the vaccine in black children. <br />
Hooker became interested in the vaccine issue after his son seriously regressed after receiving 3 vaccines at 15 months. <br />
He spent years trying to get information from the CDC about vaccine trials, often through freedom of information requests.
<br />
 
He was surprised when a CDC scientist wanted to talk to him. <br />
Obviously he was feeling guilty and he helped Hooker ask better questions of the CDC to get more and more information about the association between vaccines and autism, and other diseases.
<br />
 
This culminated in a paper that Hooker published in August of 2014, which was quickly taken down by the publisher (the German publishing giant Springer) on the basis of an undeclared conflict of interest (which never existed according to Hooker) and statistical problems, which were never elucidated.
<br />
 
As you will hear from this conversation, Hooker remains calm despite the storm swirling around him, and plans to continue with his analysis and publication of CDC data and other information concerning problems with vaccines, particularly in the United States where many more vaccines are used than in other countries.<br />
