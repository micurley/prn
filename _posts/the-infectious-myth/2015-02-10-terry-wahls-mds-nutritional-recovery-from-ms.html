    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Terry Wahls MD’s Nutritional Recovery from MS
---
Terry Wahls is another example of a miraculous recovery after rejecting standard medical advice.
<!--more-->
But, in this case it was a mainstream MD who had this experience. <br />
Terry Wahls tells David about her descent into Multiple Sclerosis (MS) over a period of years, until she got to the point where she could no longer work, and spent most of her time in a wheelchair. <br />
She had found that a so-called “paleo” diet (heavy on meats, including fat, and vegetables, with few carbohydrates) had stopped her symptoms from worsening, but was not helping her improve. <br />
She used her still functioning mind to design her diet more scientifically, and then within a few months she was walking without assistance, and within a year rode a bicycle 30 kilometers.
<br />
 
Terry was anxious to share her personal discovery and, in doing so, discovered that it worked for many modern diseases, that are created or exacerbated by the modern low fat, high carbohydrate diet. <br />
This eventually led to her book, “The Wahls Protocol” and also dietary research on MS and other diseases.
<br />
 
This is a fascinating discussion that will probably lead many listeners to read her book or recommend it to others. <br />
You can find more at http://terrywahls.com, including how to read a sample or obtain a copy of her book, watch videos,  and donate to her research projects.
