        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

In Episode 29 David Crowe talks with Bobby Russell, falsely diagnosed with HIV infection in 2004.

It was not until 2013 that Bobby discovered what he had been searching for, that his hospital (University of Kentucky Medical Center) had performed a Western Blot confirmatory test back then – and it had come back negative.
<br />
 
He had been on toxic AIDS drugs for almost a decade now, suffering major side effects, believing that he would die without the drugs. <br />
But now he knew for sure that they had just been destroying his life and his health. <br />
With this test result in his hands he launched a lawsuit but recently it was dismissed by the judge on the basis that he had waited too long.
<br />
 
It is true that he had suspicions about his original Western Blot test before 2013, but without the test result in his hands he obviously could not launch a lawsuit.
