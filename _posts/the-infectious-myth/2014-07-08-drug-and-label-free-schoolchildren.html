        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

In Episode 20 David talks with Sheila Matthews, co-founder of http://ablechild.org, an organization dedicated ensuring<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

that American children can go to school free of coercion to take psychotropic drugs, and free of mental illness labels, such as ADHD. <br />
Sheila has lobbied against the increasing tendency of schools to try to diagnose children within a model that ensures that the large number diagnosed will be routed to psychiatrists and put on drugs. <br />
She had success with a Connecticut law that prohibited school officials from recommending drugs and with an FDA decision to put black box labels on anti-depressants warning of violent and suicidal behavior.
<br />
 
The massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school, in Sheila’s home state of Connecticut, is one example of the association between a tragic event and a young man on psychiatric drugs. <br />
Sheila has investigated and is troubled by some missing information. <br />
Why are Adam Lanza’s medical records not available. <br />
Why are the contents of an envelope addressed to the school children not public? <br />
Why is the DNA on that envelope not of Adam Lanza but of an unidentified convicted criminal? <br />
Why has the information on two GPS devices found in his car and home not been made public? <br />
Did Lanza go anywhere else, such as a mental health clinic, around that time?
<br />
 
This is a fascinating and thought-provoking discussion.<br />
