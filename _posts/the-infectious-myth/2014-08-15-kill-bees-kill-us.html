Episode 25 is not talking about killer bees, but about bee killers, the neo-nicotinoid systemic pesticides that most<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

knowledgeable people outside the chemical manufacturers are blaming for colony collapse disorder.<br />
 
David’s guest is Dave Hackenberg,  who owns a company that trucks large numers of honeybee colonies around the United States to pollinate crops, when and where they are needed. <br />
They talk about the importance of bees to many crops in the United States that will not produce seed without a pollinator, and how the concept of a systemic pesticide fills the entire plant with poison, including the nectar and pollen that feed the bee.
<br />
Dave Hackenberg got serious about this problem when he lost 80% of his hives in the 2006 season, and his research led him to believe that neonicotinoids were the cause. <br />
Since then he has lobbied tirelessly, and awareness of this problem is certainly growing, thanks to him, other bee-keepers, environmentalists, and a few researchers who are brave enough to withstand attacks from the chemical companies.
<br />
Politics is a big problem, and with industrial agriculture lobbyists funding so many politicians, getting political action is difficult. <br />
Even supposedly neutral agencies like the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and USDA (US Department of Agriculture) appear to be acting mostly in the interests of the chemical and seed companies. <br />
There are several lawsuits against the EPA and other government organizations for rushed and inadequate approval of pesticides.<br />
