    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria

In Episode 40 David wraps up coverage of the Ebola epidemic, which is now winding down.
<!--more-->
He points out that the CDC, WHO and African governments have more money, and GSK has its vaccine trials well under way. <br />
The money has been made, the infectious panic is not needed any more.
<br />
 
The vaccine causes David to segue into talking about the polio vaccine, because this is considered to be the most successful vaccine in history, except that simply examining the timing of polio epidemics tells us that this could not be the case, that the epidemic was declining long before the majority of people were vaccinated<br />
