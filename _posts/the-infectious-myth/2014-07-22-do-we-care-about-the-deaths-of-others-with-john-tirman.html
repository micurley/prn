title: Do we care about the deaths of others? With John Tirman
---
In Episode 22 David talks with John Tirman, scholar and author of the 2011 book, “The Deaths of others: The fate of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

civilians in America’s wars”. <br />
This book attempts to quantify the number of civilians killed during recent major American wars – Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. <br />
Tirman discusses the evidence that allow approximation of the vast scale of these deaths, by bombing, ancillary violence, the destruction of infrastructure, starvation, shooting by soldiers and a myriad of other causes. <br />
He discusses how household surveys can provide the most accurate information. <br />
In Iraq this estimated 600,000 Iraqi deaths (the majority civilian) by 2006.
<br />
 
Tirman also discusses the indifference of the American population to civilian deaths in these wars, and the resistance of pro-war forces inside and out of government to admit that any inordinate number of deaths occurs. <br />
Often there is a technique of focusing on minor flaws in the research, and trying to draw attention away from the big picture.
