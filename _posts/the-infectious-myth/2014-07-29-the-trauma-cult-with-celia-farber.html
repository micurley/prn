        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria

title: The Trauma Cult, with Celia Farber

In Episode 23 David interviews pioneering and heretical AIDS journalist Celia Farber about the “Trauma Cult” and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

“Totalitarian Science”. <br />
She compares the HIV=AIDS dogma, which she questioned in articles dating back to the late 1980s, to a totalitarian cult. <br />
In this cult HIV is not a positive God, who will bring enlightenment if you rigidly adhere to the cult leader’s dictates, but HIV is a Satan who you can never eliminate and, even if you did, you would never achieve the life and health you had before you started your battle.
<br />
An interesting question that David poses to Celia, who is anti-communist through her own experiences growing up in Sweden, as well as from her father, well known right-wing radio host Barry Farber, is how such a totalitarian cult emerged from the country that has long claimed to be the leader of the free world, the United States.
<br />
The conversation is made more scintilating because of the different outlooks that David and Celia on life and on the world.
<br />
