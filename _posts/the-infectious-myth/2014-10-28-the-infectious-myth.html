    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

Episode 34 – Ebola is not an infectious epidemic.
<!--more-->
Ebola virus has not been proven to exist
 
David reveals his preliminary research on Ebola, and why it is probably not an infectious disease. <br />
The major problems are the shoddy nature of the original research that claimed to have found a new hemorraghic fever virus, the lack of certainty in the testing, and a diagnosis that creates the illusion of infectivity, and that no longer requires hemorraghic symptoms (such as massive bleeding from the mouth, eyes and anus).
<br />
 
Fear is driving the world to clinical trials of new vaccines and drugs, that will result in massive profits, but will not solve the health problems of Africa, which are related to poverty, war and inequitable economies. <br />
The west only cares about Ebola because of our fear that it will cross oceans and devastate us. <br />
Sadly, deaths in vaccine or drug trials, or in later use of those products, will not concern the west.
<br />
 
The US military would love to have the headquarters of their Africa Command (Africom) in Africa, and not in Germany, and the militarized response to Ebola is a wedge that may allow them to do this.
