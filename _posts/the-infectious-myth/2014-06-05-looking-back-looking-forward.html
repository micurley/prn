    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

In Episode 15 of “The Infectious Myth” David reviews the first 14 episodes of this show, reviewing what the major<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
points of the guests were, and what this tells us about science in general, and other aspects of our society. <br />
David also reviews ideas for future shows. <br />
He thanked, sardonically, the many censors in the world, without whom David’s guests would probably be too busy with the mainstream media to come on to “The Infectious Myth”. <br />
Expect many more interesting guests in the future.
