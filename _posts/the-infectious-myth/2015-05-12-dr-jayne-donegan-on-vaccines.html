title: Dr. Jayne Donegan on Vaccines

Dr. Jayne Donegan is a Homeopath and General Practitioner in England.
<!--more-->
Starting from a mainstream position, based on what she learned in medical school, she gradually questioned vaccination more and more, and also looked at the roots of what are believed to be purely infectious diseases, like diphtheria and measles, including social and environmental conditions, nutrition and yes, even love. <br />
Eventually her skepticism about vaccines got her in trouble with medical authorities but after an epic battle the General Medical Council agreed that her viewpoints were scientifically based, and she was able to retain her medical license.
