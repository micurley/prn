    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Judith Levine on Sexual Assault, Bad Behaviour and Sexual Misunderstandings
---
David talks with Judith Levine in Episode 42 about sexual
assault, particularly about whether new ideas about<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
“affirmative consent” are
going to lead to injustices. <br />
The conversation also covers a description of
restorative justice, and how it can produce better outcomes for both the victim
and the perpetrator (if both decide to participate), leading to behavior
changes without the lifelong consequences of a sexual crime conviction. <br />
David
and Judith talk about several recent cases, some of which involve minor sexual
misconduct, and some appear to involve the punishment of perfectly normal
sexual behavior, based on this new desire to use harsh mechanisms to eradicate
sexual misconduct on college campuses. <br />
And why so much attention to campuses, where
increasingly financially privileged young people congregate, and not the home, workplace
or the military or other domains? <br />
Is this actually class bias masquerading as a
desire for justice?
<br />
 
Judith Levine is the author of four books, most relevantly
the award winning, “Harmful To
Minors: The Perils Of Protecting Children From Sex”. <br />
She has also
written many articles, such as  “To stop campus rape, let kids grow up”. <br />

and “Campus Rules are about Punishment not Sex”, http://bostonreview.<br />

<br />
She is on the board of the National Center for Reason &amp; Justice
 (ncrj.<br />
org).
