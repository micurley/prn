    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

In Episode 52 of “The Infectious Myth” David talks about freedom of speech.
<!--more-->
“Je ne suis pas Charlie Hebdou” (I am not Charlie Hebdou) but that doesn’t mean that he is in favor of terrorism either. <br />
Freedom of speech is a complicated issue, and despite all the rhetoric that followed the horrible massacre in January, the liberal west is not as open about freedom of speech as we’d like to think. <br />
We routinely censor hateful discussions against Jews and Blacks, because we saw where that led. <br />
But attacking muslims, who are a reviled minority with little power in most western countries, is fair game.
<br />
 
David also points out that suppression of speech extends to medical issues, particularly the HIV=AIDS dogma and vaccination. <br />
He ends with the discussion of the Dalhousie Dental students, who have been raked over the coals for vile sexist commentary on a private facebook group, commentary that nobody defended as freedom of speech, even though it occurred at about the same time as Charlie Hebdou.
<br />
 
But the good thing is that the university handled the situation, not by strict punishments, to make an example of the men, but by a process of restorative justice. <br />
Which, David believes, is how we should deal with each other rather than always trying to divide the world into good and evil.<br />
