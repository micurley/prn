    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Positive Hell with Joan Shenton
---
David talks with veteran film maker Joan Shenton about her new joint product with Andi Reiss, “Positive Hell”<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
(http://immunity.org.<br />
uk), about a group of Spanish HIV-positives, who have either never taken AIDS drugs or took them only for a short time. <br />
All were severe IV drug addicts or, in the case of their medical advisor, Dr Manuel Garrido, a severe alcoholic. <br />
All of them conquered their addiction, and reclaimed their health, eventually rejecting their AIDS diagnosis.
<br />
 
The interviews in this new video include a woman who went on to get married and have a child with her new husband. <br />
Despite more than two decades of unprotected sex, he is still HIV-negative.
<br />
 
The story of Dr Garrido is interesting because he is not just the medical advisor, but he has lived his advice, as he is also HIV-positive, and has also declined AIDS drugs.
<br />
 
This should be the kind of hopeful story that will rock the world. <br />
But the experience of Joan Shenton shows that this will be difficult. <br />
Her career as a successful medical documentary producer was destroyed in the early 1990s after a documentary first won a major award and then was the subject of a “Star Chamber” investigation.
<br />
 
Joan is the instigator of the Immune Resource Foundation website (http://immunity.org.<br />
uk) that has a huge archive of critical AIDS documentaries and other video footage. <br />
Also with Andi Reiss she recently co-produced the film “Positively False: Birth of a Heresy” (http://positivelyfalsemovie.<br />
com) and is republishing her book this year, also called “Positively False”.
