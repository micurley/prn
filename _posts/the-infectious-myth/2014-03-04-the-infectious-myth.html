        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

In Episode 2 David Crowe talks with Dr.
<!--more-->
Charles Geshekter, a retired professor of African history, and an expert in Somalia. <br />
He talks about how the AIDS theory dumbs down our approach to African problems to a single virus but that, using Somalia as an example, each region has unique historical, cultural and geographical factors that have led them to their current situation. <br />
Dr Geshekter also talks about  how he first started to question the HIV=AIDS dogma because he could not believe that accurate statistics could be gathered from many countries in Africa, where even basic infrastructure did not function. <br />
He applied those questions to statistics in his home state of California. <br />
There, statistics are gathered with more rigor, but contain striking anomalies that nobody seemed interested in trying to explain.
