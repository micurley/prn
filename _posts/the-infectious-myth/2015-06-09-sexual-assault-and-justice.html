In Episode 61 David tackles the difficult subject of false claims of sexual assault.
<!--more-->
Society needs to deal seriously with the historical tragedy of male sexual violence, mostly against women, but also against other men. <br />
But recent high profile cases illustrate that false claims are a real problem and create real injustices against innocent men. <br />
David examines some prominent cases in detail and highlights some of the legal and moral issues. <br />
Although false claims of rape or sexual assault are rare, some of the cases have been so dramatic that there is a risk that they will result in over-criminalization of sexual relations. <br />
Also, society may still make women feel shame over expressing their sexual desire, and in cases when this becomes public, the shame they are made to feel may make some of them argue that the sex wasn’t consensual due to their age, consumption of alcohol, etc.
