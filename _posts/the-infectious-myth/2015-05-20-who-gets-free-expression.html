In Episode 59 David discusses freedom of expression, not just freedom of speech, but even the freedom to carry a gun.

David chooses examples from the new YouTube-inspired phenomenon of FHITP used to sandbag interviews by female reporters, the right to openly carry a gun, the censorship of Gary Null by KPFA in Berkeley, and the response to Seymour Hersh’s new article claiming that just about everything we’ve been told about the Osama Bin Laden raid is false.
