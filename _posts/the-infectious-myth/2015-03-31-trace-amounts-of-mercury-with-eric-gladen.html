        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Trace Amounts (of Mercury) with Eric Gladen

In episode 53 David discusses the film “Trace Amounts”, subtitled, “Autism, Mercury and the Hidden Truth”, with film<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

maker Eric Gladen. <br />
But he is more than just a film maker, he suffered tremendously after receiving a tetanus vaccine in 2004, containing the ethyl mercury preservative Thimerosal. <br />
His symptoms were very similar to those of a child with autism, and it was not until he took chelation therapy to remove the mercury that his symptoms started to regress. <br />
His personal experience led him to lead this film project.<br />
 
The discussion focuses on the scientific evidence that the ethyl mercury in Thimerosal is poisonous, the very active role the CDC has played in covering this up, and denying it, as well as the current use of this toxic preservative in vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine. <br />
Finally they discuss Eric’s own experience, and how he found that removing the mercury from his body helped him eliminate devastating physical and psychological ill effects and regain good health.

More information can be found at http://traceamounts.com, and the film will be available for rent or purchase on April 2, 2015.<br />
