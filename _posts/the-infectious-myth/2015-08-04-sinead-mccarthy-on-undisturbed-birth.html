        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Sinead McCarthy on Undisturbed Birth
---
In episode 68 David talks with Sinead McCarthy about undisturbed or unassisted birth, in which a woman, and her<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

partner, take full responsibility for the birth, without even a doula or midwife. <br />
They talk about the medicalization and institutionalization of pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding, and how birth is a natural process that can be reclaimed by mothers.
<br />
Sinead recommends the writings of Sarah Buckley, MD, author of “Gentle Birth. <br />
Gentle Mothering” (http://sarahbuckley.com) and of Michel Odent, MD, a male surgeon who pioneered a much more natural and humane approach to birth (https://en.wikipedia.<br />
org/wiki/Michel_Odent). <br />
She also recommends the website of two midwives who opted out of licensing to gain more freedom:http://www.indiebirth.com
Sinead’s own website is: http://sacredmaternity.com
