    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

David talks with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny about vaccines.
Dr. Sherri J.
<!--more-->
Tenpenny is an osteopathic medical doctor, board certified in three medical specialties. <br />
From 1986 to 1998, she was a full time Emergency Medicine physician and the director of the Emergency Department in Findlay, Ohio. <br />
In 1996, she opened a center for Integrative medicine. <br />
Patients have come from nearly all 50 states and 14 countries to get well using a combination of conventional and holistic therapies. <br />
Dr Tenpenny has also produced several books and DVDs.<br />
 
David and Sherri discuss the side effects of vaccines, the history and politics of vaccines, and the future of even more vaccines, provided in an even more coercive fashion. <br />
It is truly a scary time for people with concerns about vaccines, especially (but not only) parents, and it is time to get educated and get politically active. <br />
You cannot rely on the political system or the mainstream media to bring sanity back.
