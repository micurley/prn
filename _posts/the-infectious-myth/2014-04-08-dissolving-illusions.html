        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria

In episode 7 of “The Infectious Myth” David Crowe talks with Suzanne Humphries MD and Roman Bystrianyk, authors of the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
2012 book, “Dissolving Illusions”, a critical history of vaccination.<br />
Suzanne is a mainstream kidney specialist who started to notice that many people coming into emergency with kidney failure were recently vaccinated, which prompted her to start her own research. <br />
Roman overcame his own health problems due to bad diet and lifestyle in a natural way, and applied this knowledge to learning more about the vaccination of his own children. <br />
Together they put their information together into a very well referenced book.<br />
Together they discuss the history of vaccination, particularly focussing on Smallpox, Polio and the combined vaccine of Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DTP or DPT). <br />
Their information identifies non-infectious causes for some of the symptoms, such as bad living conditions and pesticides, identifies how the treatment of doctors sometimes worsened the disease, and most particularly, how most epidemics had declined, sometimes by as much as 99%, before the vaccine came into use.For more information about the book by this week’s guests please see http://dissolvingillusions.com.<br />
