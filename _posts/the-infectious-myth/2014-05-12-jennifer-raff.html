vaccines. <br />
Her opinion is that virtually all information claiming that vaccines are unsafe or ineffective is wrong, and that parents should just listen to respected scientific sources. Her blog post, entitled, “Parents you are being lied to”, quickly went viral, especially after it was picked up by the Huffington Post.<br />
 This interview is a vivid reminder of the difficulty of having an open discussion on the issue of vaccines. <br />
People are being lied to about vaccines, but which side is doing the majority of the lying?<br />
