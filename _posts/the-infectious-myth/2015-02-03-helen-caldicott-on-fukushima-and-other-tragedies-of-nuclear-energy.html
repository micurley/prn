for decades. <br />
She has led movements against nuclear testing and nuclear power, has written books, and has spoken all over the world. <br />
In this episode David and Helen talk mainly about nuclear power, and particularly about the problem of nuclear waste, about so-called environmentalists who see nuclear power as a solution to global warming, and about solutions to the energy crisis through alternatives. <br />
Helen discusses a report that she commissioned indicating that a full transition to alternative energy is feasible.
<br />
 
Helen is participating in a Symposium, “The Dynamics of Possible Nuclear Extinction” from February 28-March 1, 2015 at The New York Academy of Medicine. <br />
