mandatory vaccination legislation known as SB-277. <br />
She explains how she first became concerned about vaccines while doing research as a new mother, the influence of money on politics, the problems with vaccinating for normally mild diseases like measles, and how the legislation will effect children currently in school, or those who will be changing schools. <br />
