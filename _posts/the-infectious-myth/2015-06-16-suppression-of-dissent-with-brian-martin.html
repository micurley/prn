    subtitle: “The Infectious Myth” will examine disease paradigms and the scientific
        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Suppression of Dissent with Brian Martin
---
David interviews Professor Brian Martin of the University of Wollongong in Episode 62.
<!--more-->
Brian has a PhD in Physics, but has taught a wide range of other subjects, and specializes in studying non-violence, whistleblowing and scientific controversies.
<br />

The subjects of the discussion are wide ranging, from military and intelligence leaks to nuclear war and nuclear power to vaccination, nutrition, wireless devices and fluoridation. <br />
It is not so much the specific subject areas that are discussed as much as how people fight against corruption, eg by whistleblowing, or by scientifically studying the damages of industrial and medical products. <br />
And how the establishment attempts to squash this dissent. <br />
But not all is doom and gloom, Brian believes that it was citizen movements that ended atmospheric nuclear testing and resulted in strong laws against tobacco sales and marketing, so concerted effort can make a difference.
<br />

Note: Due to a technical failure David’s portion of the discussion was re-taped from a transcript.<br />
