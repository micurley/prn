        or historical evidence that the simple story we are told about a virus, bacteria
        or gene causing a disease, is probably false.

title: Lisa Bloomquist on Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics
---
Lisa Bloomquist is someone who believes she was injured by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, of which the most famous one is<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Cipro. <br />
She struggled to recognize the strange but serious symptoms this formerly very active woman had. <br />
She reached out to others having similar problems, and she did a lot of scientific research as well. <br />
One she started to reclaim her health she began collating the stories of many other people, and trying to raise awareness of the problems these antibiotics can cause.
<br />
 
Lisa believes that there are poorly studied interactions between the medications and other drugs. <br />
Because the drug is so tightly bound by the body, the side effects can occur quite some time after the antibiotics are taken.
<br />
 
Lisa and David talk about what the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are, why they were designed, how they work, what side effects there are, and why she chose to focus on her own health rather than suing the drug company (hint: it probably wouldn’t have been possible anyway).
