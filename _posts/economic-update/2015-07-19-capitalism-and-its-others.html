title: Capitalism and its Others
---
Today’s program focuses on two alternatives to capitalism.
<!--more-->
The first is an alternative to how capitalism organizes enterprises in terms of their internal workings and relationships. <br />
We examine workers self-directed enterprises: how they work and how they compare to capitalist enterprises. <br />
In the program’s second half we look at an alternative to how capitalism organizes the economy as a whole: the socialist tradition that has evolved multiple different forms in the world today. <br />
We examine how socialism has evolved, its complex relationship with government, and how socialism compares with capitalism.
