2012, and phony DC “debt-ceiling” theatrics. <br />
Discussion of Swiss bank crimes, Keynesian vs Marxian economics, political turmoil in 2013, and criticism of markets. <br />
Response to question on new capital gains taxes.
<br />
On Economic Update with Professor Richard Wolff, Wolff and guests will discuss the current state of the economy, both locally and globally in relation to the economic crisis.
<br />
Wolff will focus on wages, jobs, taxes, and debts - and on interest rates, prices, and profits. <br />
We aim to explain why certain economic changes are happening and other changes get postponed or blocked and we will explore alternative ways to organize enterprises, markets, and government policies. <br />
Economic Update is a weekly show for people who want to understand and change not only their own financial situation but also the larger economy we all depend on.
