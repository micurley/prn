How Does Fracking Impact Property Rights?
<!--more-->
Alison’s guest is Mike Benard, an expert on landowner issues and property rights with an organization called Spectra Energy Watch at http://www.spectraenergywatch.<br />
com. <br />
Benard, a Pennsylvania landowner and his group have been ‘connecting the dots’ to learn that the government can actually help the gas industry take your land. <br />
“Eminent domain is a growing issue in many communities because there are too many examples where eminent domain means someone wants your property,” Benard says, “ … and the government helps them take it.”  For this week’s action to tell Governor Cuomo whether or not you support his recent decision to allow fracking in New York State, please go Alison’s action links and free ezine signup at: www.healthjournalistblog.com
