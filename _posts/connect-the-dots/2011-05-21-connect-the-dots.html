The Bond
On this show, Alison Rose Levy will welcome Lynne McTaggart to discuss her new book, The Bond (Free Press).
<!--more-->
McTaggart, a bestselling author of The Intention Experiment and The Field, looks into scientific research to discover that we’ve set our civilization to function by competing with each other as we glorify ourselves as individuals. <br />
This stands in direct contradiction to the way we are designed by nature, which entails bonding, cooperation, and fairness. <br />
