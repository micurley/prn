The Bond
On this show, Alison Rose Levy will welcome Lynne McTaggart to discuss her new book, The Bond (Free Press).
<!--more-->
McTaggart, a bestselling author of The Intention Experiment and The Field, looks into scientific research to discover that weâ€™ve set our civilization to function by competing with each other as we glorify ourselves as individuals. <br />
This stands in direct contradiction to the way we are designed by nature, which entails bonding, cooperation, and fairness. <br />
