This week’s Project Censored program focuses on the hazards of hydraulic fracturing (”fracking”) and federal officials’<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
attempts to downplay some those hazards.<br />
  
US EPA officials denied last year that groundwater contamination in Dimock, Pennsylvania was due to fracking, although EPA’s own scientists knew that fracking was the culprit. <br />
And, whistleblowers say, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used a false name in internal correspondence about the Dimock situation. <br />
Mickey Huff and Peter Phillips interview Steve Horn, writer for www.desmogblog.com, discusses these stories. Then Richard Heinberg of the Post-Carbon Institute speaks about his new book “Snake Oil: How Fracking’s False Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future.” Heinberg explains the hazards to water and air from fracking.<br />
