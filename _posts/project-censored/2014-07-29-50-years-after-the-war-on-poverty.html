title: 50 Years After the War on Poverty

This week’s Project Censored show opens with economic issues, and wraps up with an interview with a VA whistleblower. <span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Fifty years have passed since LBJ announced the War On Poverty. <br />
The first guest, Keith Kilty, describes the how poverty was reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, before the programs were cut back and the poverty rate rose again. <br />
Then economist Doug Orr of San Francisco City College looks at the stock market – how relevant are the market’s gyrations to the real economy? <br />
Orr also explains “frontrunning,” a tactic used by market insiders to enrich themselves. <br />
The program concludes with a conversation about whistleblowing in the federal government, with Oliver Mitchell, a whistleblower in the Veterans Administration, and Marcel Reid, organizer of a whistleblowers’ summit (www.whistleblowersummit.<br />
com) in Washington, DC.
