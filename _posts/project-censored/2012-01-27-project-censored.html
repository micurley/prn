We’ll hear about the Against Cuts Conference happening tomorrow at Berkeley City College, student organizer Dielly Diaz joins us from UC Berkeley; Lisa Graves of the Center for Media and Democracy returns to the program to discuss the American Legislative Exchange Council- and ALEC’s recent censoring of the press in AZ; at the bottom of the hour we hear from Steve Zeltzer of Work Week Radio with the labor calendar; and we conclude the show we talk to attorney and president of the Public Banking Institute Ellen Brown about a Jubilee on Student Loan Debt, which is one of the many concerns of the Occupy Wall St. <br />
movement.<br />
