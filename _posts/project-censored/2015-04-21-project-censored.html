Concerns. <br />
They’ll look at some of the controversies surrounding Smart Meters, including those revealed in e mails between CA PG&amp;E and the CA PUC, among these are spying on customer use and sharing private information with third parties, which has been confirmed by the Northern California ACLU. <br />
They interview Cindy Sage of Sage Associates, an international environmental sciences consulting firm in Santa Barbara, and Sandi Maurer with the EMF Safety Network. <br />
They close the program in discussion with Kenn Burrows, longtime lecturer and director of the Holistic Health Leaning Center at San Francisco State University, where they address the precautionary principle and the broader and increasingly relevant public health risks associated with EMFs and WiFi technologies that are being recognized both in the scientific community and by governments around the world.
