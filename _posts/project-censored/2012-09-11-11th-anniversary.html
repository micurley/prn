Today we bring you our 9/11 11th Anniversary Program:  9/11, Conspiracy Theory, and State Crimes Against Democracy.
<!--more-->
Joining us for the hour will be authors and professors James F. <br />
Tracy and Lance deHaven Smith. <br />
 At the bottom of the hour, Project Censored intern Kimberly Soeiro reads excerpts of letters published by the Journal of 9/11 Studies from thoughtful people who have reflected on the tragic events of that day, and we end todayâ€™s program hearing about the annual 9/11 Film Festival coming up next week at the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland, CA.
