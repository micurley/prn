Education- on the ballot in CA for fall of 2012; Sociologist and former Project Censored associate director Dr Andrew Roth joins in our discussion about education “deform” and it’s impact on colleges; we’ll hear from Steve Zeltzer of Work Week Radio on Butchering Education and Systemic Corruption; and we round out the show in conversation with a leading critic of education reform Diane Ravitch, former assistant secretary of education under George HW Bush, who is currently a researcher at NYU, on why No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top simply are not working and what we should be doing to revitalize our educational system.
