Following a nonfatal outbreak of measles that began at Disneyland, the California Legislature is debating a bill (SB<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
277) to outlaw parental choice about childhood vaccinations. <br />
The bill would include the measles vaccine, as well as nine others.<br />
 
Today’s guests support vaccinations, but oppose making them compulsory; they discuss the issues involved from a variety of perspectives, including law, civil rights, and medical ethics. <br />
Caitlyn Obolsky and Robert Krakow are attorneys; Elliot Cohen teaches ethics at Florida State University Medical School; Sharyl Attkisson is an investigative journalist; Lori Martin Gregory is editor of the Mom Street Journal.
