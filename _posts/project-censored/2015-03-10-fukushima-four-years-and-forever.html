Cindy Folkers speaks about the hazards of radioactive particles, and the inadequate monitoring of the Fukushima radiation releases. <br />
Retired nuclear engineer Arnie Gunderson looks at the overall safety record of nuclear power and finds it wanting. <br />
And Libbe HaLevy explains how people can minimize their radiation exposure.
