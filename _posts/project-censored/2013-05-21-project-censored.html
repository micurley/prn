Mickey Huff  and Peter Phillips visit the issue of the new poverty in the United States as they play excerpts from the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
movie Ain’t I A Person directed by Dr Keith Kilty. <br />
From the film we will hear the voices of people trapped in poverty by expanding structural unemployment, continuing racism, and a deep seated 30 year attack on the social safety net in the US. <br />
We’ll also hear live in studio from sociology professor Sheila Katz on increases in urban poverty and the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty. <br />
