On the December 27 Project Censored Show on Pacifica Radio is entitled Nelson Mandela and the Legacy of Apartheid.
<!--more-->
Recently, hosts Mickey Huff and Peter Phillips had a discussion with independent journalist and filmmaker Danny Schechter, author of Madiba A to Z: the Many Faces of Nelson Mandela; and Dr Amer Araim, who worked at the United Nations for 14 years to end apartheid in South Africa and has written about Mandela’s legacy and the situation in Israel/Palestine. <br />
On this week’s program, we play that prerecorded interview. <br />
Special thanks to our producer, Anthony Fest.
