This week’s Project Censored Show is from our JFK special.
<!--more-->
This hour we air our interview with Mark Lane.
<br />

This week on the Project Censored Show on Pacifica Radio, Peter Phillips and Mickey Huff recently interviewed Mark Lane as part of their four hour JFK anniversary special. <br />
We air that interview in our hourly spot this week. <br />
Mark Lane is an attorney and a leading researcher/author on the assassination of President Kennedy. <br />
From his 1966 bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, Rush to Judgment, and later work Plausible Denial, to Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK, Lane is noted as a key expert in matters regarding the JFK assassination and subsequent government cover-up.<br />
