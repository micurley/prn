Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, they look at Law Enforcement Related Deaths and the increasing concerns in the US about police violence. <br />
Joining them is October 22nd activist and legal advocate Karen Saari, who has researched the number of newspaper reported police shootings in the US. Diana Grant, professor of Criminal Justice at Sonoma State University, joins the program to address the question- why does the US government fail to accurately report law enforcement related deaths?<br />
 In the second half of the program they speak with Censored 2015 editor professor Andy Roth, and  liberal studies professor Francisco Vazquez who is serving on the Sonoma County Community and Local Law Enforcement Task Force. <br />
They close with a brief update from filmmaker Dylan Avery on his new project Black and Blue that looks at the problem of police brutality.
