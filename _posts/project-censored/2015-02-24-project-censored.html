Mickey Huff and his guests discuss two major public health issues.
<!--more-->
First, investigative journalist Peter Byrne examines myths and realities about breast cancer, and how corporate “philanthropy” influences public discourse. <br />
Next,  plaintiffs’ attorney Nate Mudd explains how asbestos-related diseases take thousands of lives each year in the US, yet asbestos remains in use. <br />
Mudd also looks at pending legislation that could reduce compensation for victims of mesothelioma and other diseases caused by asbestos.
