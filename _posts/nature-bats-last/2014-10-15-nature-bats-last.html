    subtitle: Nature Bats Last is the most radical show on the radio. Hosts Mike Sliwa
        and Guy McPherson get to the root of relevant issues facing society. We begin
        by pointing out that despite our profound influence on the planet, the natural
        world cannot be overcome by human hubris.
