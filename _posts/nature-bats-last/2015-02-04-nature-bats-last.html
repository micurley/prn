    subtitle: Nature Bats Last is the most radical show on the radio. Hosts Mike Sliwa
        and Guy McPherson get to the root of relevant issues facing society. We begin
        by pointing out that despite our profound influence on the planet, the natural
        world cannot be overcome by human hubris.

McPherson and Sliwa respond to short clips from comedians George Carlin, Louis CK, Bill Hicks, and Hari Kondabolu. <br />
After each clip, we provide commentary about the clip and link the humor to contemporary events.
