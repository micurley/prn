    subtitle: Nature Bats Last is the most radical show on the radio. Hosts Mike Sliwa
        and Guy McPherson get to the root of relevant issues facing society. We begin
        by pointing out that despite our profound influence on the planet, the natural
        world cannot be overcome by human hubris.

We are honored to interview Derrick Jensen this week.

Jensen has been hailed as the “poet-philosopher of the ecological movement” by Amy Goodman on Democracy Now. <br />
His scholarly efforts have produced Endgame, The Culture of Make Believe, A Language Older than Words, and nearly two dozen other books.<br />
 Plus at least two new Breaking Hopium segments and a climate update! <br />
Tune in Tuesday at 3pm eastern!
