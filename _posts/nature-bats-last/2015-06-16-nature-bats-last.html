    subtitle: Nature Bats Last is the most radical show on the radio. Hosts Mike Sliwa
        and Guy McPherson get to the root of relevant issues facing society. We begin
        by pointing out that despite our profound influence on the planet, the natural
        world cannot be overcome by human hubris.

Today on NBL we have husband and wife Aaron Lahman and Sara Leoni.

They will share their story of travel, justice, liberation and living consciously. <br />
They are truly chasing a different carrot. <br />
Plus we touch on the climate news of the day and the continued insanity of the industrial model.Â
