    subtitle: Nature Bats Last is the most radical show on the radio. Hosts Mike Sliwa
        and Guy McPherson get to the root of relevant issues facing society. We begin
        by pointing out that despite our profound influence on the planet, the natural
        world cannot be overcome by human hubris.

This week’s show features two news items beyond the mainstream.
<!--more-->
One links Robin Williams’ suicide to abundant environmental information, the other reports on a group of 24 indigenous men, women, and children that have emerged from their Amazon home weeks after another group fled aggressors in Peru. <br />
We cover a lot of ground with American Joseph Zummach and Canadian Paul Marcotte, both of whom are living well beyond the mainstream. <br />
We check in with Forrest Palmer and Lindsay Morrison as they break hopium. <br />
Our Doomer of the Week is Cheveyo Lone Eagle. <br />
We wrap up with a brief climate-change update.
