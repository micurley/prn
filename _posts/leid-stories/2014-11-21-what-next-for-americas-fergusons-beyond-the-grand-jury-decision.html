title: 'What Next for America’s Fergusons?: Beyond the Grand Jury Decision'

Our discussions this week are a primer on the legal issues involved in a case that has commanded national and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
international attention—the killing of Michael Brown, a young black man, by Darren Wilson, a white officer with the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri.
<br />
A grand jury that has been reviewing the case for three months imminently is expected to announce whether it has voted criminal charges against Wilson.<br />
  But as Leid Stories pointed out, the case has been handled in such a manner that, indictment or no, the officer won’t lose.
<br />
Today we discuss the immediate and long-term future. <br />
What use will we make of the many truths learned from our analysis of this case? <br />
How will they shape our political consciousness—and, more so, our actions? <br />
What are to be the next moves for the people of Ferguson and for the Fergusons of America?
<br />
Our guest, “the people’s attorney general,” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
, frames these questions in the context of the continuum of struggle by blacks for equality and justice. <br />
Listeners contribute their thoughts.<br />
