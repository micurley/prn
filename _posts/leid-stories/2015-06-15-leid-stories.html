Hillary’s Off. And Running Against Obama?
Black Like Me: What Should Rachel Dolezal’s Story Mean to America?
<!--more-->
A vapid yawner of a speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds yesterday, scripted to the nth degree by her political handlers, did little to sell Hillary Clinton’s self-proclaimed superlative experience and skills in international trade. <br />
Instead, the Democratic presidential candidate took aim at her former boss and “buddy,” criticizing President Barack Obama’s handling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and related trade issues, but not saying where she stands on the TPP. <br />
(Note to Hillary: Obama’s not running.<br />
)
Leid Stories explains what’s behind Hillary’s attack on Obama and her murkiness about her position on the TPP and similar trade agreements. <br />
  
The national brouhaha rages on about Rachel Dolezal—the Eastern Washington University professor and president of the NAACP’s local chapter in Spokane—over her claimed African American identity.
<br />
What should Dolezal’s story, and the furor it has caused, mean to America? <br />
