Far From Benevolent: U.S.
<!--more-->
Interests in the Philippines
 
Urgently needed international aid continues to flow into the Republic of the Philippines, left utterly devastated by Typhoon Haiyan, one of the worst storms ever to hit the country.
<br />
Since Nov. <br />
8, when it struck, killing more than 4,000 and affecting more than 4 million people in 270 towns and cities, the United States has provided more than $37 million in humanitarian aid and 9,500 military personnel and disaster specialists to assist with logistical operations.
<br />
The United States has had a long history in the Philippines, but it has been far from benevolent.
<br />
Noted historian, political scientist and author Dr Gerald Horne explains the 7,107-island nation’s struggles against colonialism and imperialism and its strategic value to the United States.
<br />
Dr Horne is the chairman of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston. <br />
A prolific author, he has written more than 30 books and 100 scholarly papers and reviews on struggles against imperialism, colonialism, fascism and racism.<br />
