A Burning Faith: Black Churches, White Supremacy
Hillary Clinton’s Storied “Struggle to Fit In” with Obama
Federal<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
investigators probing a fire that destroyed Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Greeleyville, SC, last night reportedly believe arson was not the cause. <br />
The church was burned 20 years ago by Klansmen, and Mount Zion AME’s razing, the seventh Black church in the South to be destroyed by fire in recent weeks, has revived a history of white-supremacist terrorism against African Americans.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses the history of white-supremacist attacks on Black churches.
<br />
The ongoing sanitization by the media of the political history of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton continues. <br />
A Reuters story today reports that the presumptive Democratic nominee “struggled to fit in with Obama’s White House” as secretary of state. <br />
The story, typical of major-media coverage of Clinton and her campaign, deliberately omits historical perspective on how she got the Cabinet position in the first place, which might have had something to do with her storied “struggle to fit in.” Leid Stories explains.<br />
