Immigration Reform: Will Marco Rubio Quit ‘Gang of Eight?
<!--more-->

Lawyer for Trayvon Martin’s Family Voices Concerns As Trial Starts
Sen. <br />
Marco Rubio (R-FL), the politically ambitious wunderkind of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, is showing all the signs of a defector. <br />
He’d been credited with bringing the stodgy set far along on so-called immigration reform and enjoyed the warm glow of media attention, but he’s become downright disenchanted with his cohorts. <br />
Syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette explains why.
<br />
In the second half of the program, Benjamin L. <br />
Crump, the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, registers his concerns as prosecutors begin their second-degree-murder case against George Zimmerman in Seminole County, Fla.<br />
, on June 10.
