The Senate yesterday fell seven votes short of the 60 needed to pass S. 2199, the Paycheck Fairness Act.

It was a decidedly partisan vote, with all Republicans and Sen. <br />
Angus King, the Independent from Maine, turning their thumbs down on the equal-pay-for-equal-work legislation.
<br />
Predictably, the vote ignited a furor across the country – but not for the right reason, says Leid Stories. <br />
The post-vote furor should be less about gender-based pay inequity and more about the utter failure of the Democratic Party, the principal beneficiary of the so-called “women’s vote,” to assure passage of the legislation for 50 years.
<br />
A Leid Stories Commentary puts the matter into proper perspective.<br />
