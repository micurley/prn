Between A Rock and A Hard Place: Latinegros in the USA”
Jakiyah McKoy, 7, was crowned Little Miss Delaware on Aug.
<!--more-->
31. <br />
A month later, she was stripped of the title and crown because pageant officials said she could not prove her Latin heritage.
<br />
Actually, the sponsoring organization, Nuestras Raices Delaware, caved in to “complaints” that Jakiyah, who is black, “is not the best representative of Latin beauty.<br />
” A committee is “investigating” Jakiyah’s heritage, since one of the pageant’s rules is that contestants must be “at least 25-percent” Latina.
<br />
Jakiyah’s story has touched off, once again, a raging discussion about racism and skin politics in the Latino community. <br />
Leid Stories’ guest, Dr Marta Cruz-Janzen, a longtime scholar of multicultural education, rips the scab off this festering sore in her live presentation, “Between A Rock and A Hard Place: Latinegros in the USA.<br />
” A Q&amp;A follows.
