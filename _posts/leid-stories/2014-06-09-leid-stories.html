Cuts to Their Benefits
Selling Hillary 2016, Media Madness Goes Into Overdrive
Fresh from an “Axis of Evil” revival in Brussels and a litany of jingoistic D-Day speeches in Europe that committed the United States to billions of dollars in military and developmental aid, President Obama today announces a big break for US college students: They’ll get more time to pay off the astronomically inflated cost of their education.
