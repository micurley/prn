title: Bill And Hillary Clinton Must Answer For Their Roles In The Iraq Crisis
---
Even as President Barack Obama wrestles with an “appropriate” response to the crisis in Iraq, he knows he’s in a no-win<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

situation. <br />
The fact that he’s reminded congressional leaders that he doesn’t need their signoff on any action he might take confirms that the push-and-pull of vested interests is intense.
<br />
Obama and his administration are being called to account, even being blamed, for ending the bogus, nine-year, US-instigated war he didn’t start. <br />
And he’s been saddled with the nightmare of doing damage control on the history of the nation’s outrageous conduct and foreign policy in the region.
<br />
President George Bush was a chief actor in this regard. <br />
But, says Leid Stories, it was President Clinton who started the war as “dual containment,” in behalf of Israel, of Iraq and Iran. <br />
On Hillary’s presidential campaign trail, he would lie and say he opposed the war [by Bush]. <br />
And it was Hillary Clinton who not only supported the war as a US senator, but continued as secretary of state to push hardline policies against these and other emerging Muslim states—including the use of nuclear weapons against Iran.
<br />
The Clintons must answer for their roles in the Iraq crisis.<br />
