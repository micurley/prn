It’s War! – Not on Poverty, But the Poor;
Civil War or Insurrection?: What’s the Case with Syria?
<!--more-->
It’s the day after Republicans declared war on America’s poor, passing a bill to cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the day they declare war on the president’s health-care law, Obamacare.
<br />
Leid Stories takes a deep look at extreme partisan politics, why new political parties are necessary, and how voters can leverage their power.
<br />
It seems not to matter in the grand scheme of things, but Leid Stories is a stickler for clarity. <br />
Hence, these questions: Just what is going on in Syria right now? <br />
Is it a civil war? <br />
An insurrection? <br />
A coup in the making?
<br />
Find out why these are very important questions!<br />
