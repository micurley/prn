It’s Friday. Free Your Mind on Leid Stories!
It’s the end of the week and you are besotted with new thoughts and ideas.
<!--more-->
Think this is accidental? <br />
No, it’s not. <br />
It’s part of an evil plot (NSA?<br />
) to overload and short-circuit your brain and ruin any chance of you having a fun-filled, worry-free weekend.
<br />
Be kind to your mind. <br />
Bring your new thoughts and ideas to “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories and share with others similarly situated. <br />
You are assured a sympathetic, though analytical, hearing.<br />
