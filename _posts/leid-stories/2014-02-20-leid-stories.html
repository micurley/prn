False Profits: Snowden’s NSA Loot Launches Multimillion-Dollar Business
Detroit Update: Major Concerns As City Submits<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
10-Year Restructuring Plan
 
Let’s see here. <br />
A self-righteous Edward Snowden steals an alleged 1.<br />
7 million classified files from the NSA and flees the country with them. <br />
Soon, a few stories based on the files began to appear—most of them in the London Guardian under the byline of lawyer-turned-reporter Glenn Greenwald who, like his source, becomes an international hero for exposing the dark dealings of the NSA both at home and abroad. <br />
Then silence. <br />
Then word of a $250-million media operation, financed by e-Bay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar, with Greenwald in a major role—and Snowden’s looted files as a main draw.
<br />
Leid Stories calls out the false prophets and the false profits. <br />
 
This week the City of Detroit’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, is expected to present to the federal judge overseeing its controversial bankruptcy a plan for restructuring its purported $18-billion debt.
<br />
Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of Pan-African News Wire and Detroit organizer for the Workers World Parry, reports on the concerns and expectations of stakeholders, especially city workers and retirees, about Orr’s 10-year plan.<br />
