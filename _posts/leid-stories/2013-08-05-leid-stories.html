Driven to Abstraction: The Increasing Uselessness of Ideology
Most people fervently believe in something or other that<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
informs their view of the world and how, or if, they fit in it. <br />
This is especially true about politics; people tend to have reasonably well-defined ideas about government, political parties, their roles and rights as citizens, etc.
<br />
And then there are ideologs—people and organizations so utterly obsessed with proving and/or safeguarding the validity of their beliefs that they cannot, and therefore do not, engage in actually applying them. <br />
Why? <br />
Mostly because they think no one else believes exactly as they do.
<br />
Such is too often the case, says Leid Stories, with the so-called “left.<br />
”  Driven to abstraction about the correctness or purity of their ideology, they’ve become inert at a time that action is needed and, increasingly, irrelevant to real-life struggles.
