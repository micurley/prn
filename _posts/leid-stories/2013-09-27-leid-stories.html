Test Your News Knowledge on “Pop Quiz”
Leid Stories introduces “Pop Quiz,” a very sneaky way of keeping listeners on their toes.
<br />
Call in, get your news clue, then give at least three solid facts about it in 1 minute or less.
<br />
Be brave, dear friends. <br />
This being the first Pop Quiz, there is an abundance of compassion and an ardent desire to see you shine. <br />
Regular listeners should have no trouble at all.<br />
