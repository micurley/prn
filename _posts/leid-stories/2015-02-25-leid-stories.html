 A Status Report on Major World Events
Diplomatic scholar, historian, attorney and prolific author Dr Gerald Horne delivers a status report on major developments in the world today, masterfully decoding complex issues that are attached to them.
<br />
Horne, the John J. <br />
and Rebecca Moores chair of history and African American studies at the University of Houston, frames his discussion within the push-and-pull of shifting alliances among dominant powers and the emergence of new, game-changing players and events that are challenging their established order.<br />
