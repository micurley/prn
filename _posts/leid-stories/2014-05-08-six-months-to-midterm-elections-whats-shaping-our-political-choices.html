---

<!--more-->
House of Representatives and 33 US Senate seats are up for grabs; the power matrix in 46 state and four territorial legislatures dramatically can be altered; 36 governorships are available; and mayoral races in 28 key cities will determine whether and how life might change for millions of people.
