Mayoral Recall Issue Claims Activist Battling Corporate Land Grab in Michigan
The Day After the Duopoly Settled Scores:<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Where Do We Go From Here?
<br />
 
Following directives from a judge and prosecutor that a person can be convicted without evidence, an all-white jury on the eve of elections stunned residents of the almost all-Black  town of Benton Harbor, Mich.<br />
, by convicting a leader of an effort to recall the mayor, widely viewed as the henchman for Whirlpool Corporation’s plan to drive them out of the town and take over their land.
<br />
The jury found the Rev. <br />
Edward Pinkney guilty of five felony counts of voter fraud, saying he changed dates on some of the recall petitions and others were signed more than once. <br />
Berrien County prosecutor has mentioned the possibility of a maximum life sentence looms for Pinkney at his scheduled sentencing on Dec. <br />
15.<br />
 The firebrand pastor joins Leid Stories to discuss the verdict and what’s ahead.
<br />
 
Well, Selection Day—the day voters elected people they had no part in selecting—is done. <br />
The duopoly settled scores; wily, old-guard Republicans gave the smart-set Democrats and President Barack Obama a blistering beatdown, capturing both houses of Congress and a slew of governorships besides. 
Leid Stories’ listeners provide their own analyses of the duopoly’s scorched-earth battle, focusing particularly on implications for alternative political parties and movements.<br />
