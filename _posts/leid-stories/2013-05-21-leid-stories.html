Death Throes in Florida/Extreme Labor Pains in Several States: Gov.
<!--more-->
Rick Scott of Florida has on his desk a piece of legislation, the Timely Justice Act, that prisoner-rights advocates are hoping he won’t sign, but instead will veto. <br />
The act speeds up executions, requiring the governor to sign a death warrant within 30 days after a review by the state Supreme Court, and scheduling executions within 180 days. <br />
Marc Mauer, director of The Sentencing Project in Washington, DC, discusses the enormous impact the legislation would have for 404 death-row inmates in Florida, and the domino effect in other states.
<br />
Recent labor statistics are cause for alarm at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute. <br />
Doug Hall, director of EPI’s Economic Analysis and Research Network, details the devastating effect of unemployment in several key states and the persistence of race as a major factor in the growing numbers of people without jobs.
