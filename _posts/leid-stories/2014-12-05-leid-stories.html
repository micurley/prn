What’s Your Verdict?
<!--more-->
Free Your Mind About the Brown, Garner Cases
Two grand jury decisions, within nine days of each other, have rocked the nation.
<br />
On Nov. <br />
24, a grand jury decided that no charges would be brought against Darren Wilson, a former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, in the Aug. <br />
9 shooting death of Michael Brown. <br />
And two days ago, a Staten Island, NY, grand jury announced the end of deliberations on the chokehold death of Eric Garner with no indictment against Daniel Pantaleo, the NYPD officer who used the banned technique during a violent attempted arrest of Garner on July 17.
<br />
Both cases have fueled protests nationwide and internationally, with racism, injustice, human rights abuses and unchecked police power the main targets of protesters’ outrage.
<br />
What’s your verdict on the outcome of these two cases? <br />
