Feinstein’s Torture Report: An Ode to Morality, Values and Transparency
No License to Kill: Lawyers Group Wants Darren<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Wilson’s License Shot
A 525-page Senate Intelligence Committee report charging the CIA with torturing suspects detained after the Sept. <br />
11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States continues to draw fire from current and ex-agency officials and political critics. <br />
The report, they say, is one-sided, dismisses the effectiveness of “enhanced interrogation techniques” in obtaining information that helped to save lives, increases the likelihood of more terrorist attacks against the United States and Americans abroad, and ultimately is a Democrat-driven political hit against the Bush administration and Republicans generally.
<br />
Committee chair Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) defends the report as a painstakingly researched, impartial investigation that, while disheartening in its findings, was motivated by the people’s right to know, and is in keeping with “American values, morals… and rule of law.<br />
”
Leid Stories discusses ironies and contradictions of Feinstein’s dedication to transparency.

The National Bar Association—the nation’s oldest and largest national network of predominantly African American attorneys and judges—has filed a complaint with Missouri’s Department of Public Safety seeking to ban Darren Wilson, the former officer with the Ferguson Police Department who killed Michael Brown on Aug. <br />
9, from employment with any police department or as a peace officer anywhere in the state.<br />
