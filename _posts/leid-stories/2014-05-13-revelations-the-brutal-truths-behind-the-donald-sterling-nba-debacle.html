It’s a constant caveat of Leid Stories’ ongoing media-literacy exercises: Be alert, defensive consumers of information.
<!--more-->
Pay attention to what’s not being said or shown. <br />
The Donald Sterling-NBA debacle is a treasure trove for media literacy, and Leid Stories today begins a series of “classes” based specifically on the issue.
<br />
Appropriately, Part 1 concerns the media itself—how and why it has shaped the story the way it has, essentially as a morality tale about an octogenarian billionaire bigot spectacularly “outed” and reaping his just rewards as befits a pariah.
<br />
But what’s missing here? <br />
What’s the truth? <br />
What is it that we really need to know? <br />
What is it that the media won’t tell or show us?
<br />
Brace yourself for revelations.<br />
