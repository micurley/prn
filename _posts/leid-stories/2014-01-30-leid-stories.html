Unheard and Unseen: The American Way of Poverty
“Poverty” or “the poor” are words President Obama doesn’t use<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
frequently – unless he’s referring to the “extreme poverty” US foreign aid is helping to alleviate in other nations. <br />
At home, though, the president says his focus is on “income inequality.<br />
”
But 50 million Americans have little or no income; they are poor. <br />
And an estimated equal number depend on government-subsidized food programs to sustain themselves and their families. <br />
Poverty is epidemic in America.
<br />
Leid Stories presents a briefing on poverty in America by way of author Sasha Abramsky, who has written several books, articles and papers on the subject. <br />
His current work, The American Way of Poverty: How the Other Half Still Lives, serves as an update on the misery index on the large and growing segment of America that, 50 years after President Lyndon B. <br />
Johnson’s declaration of a “war on poverty,” remains largely unheard and unseen, despite vigorous advocacy and intervention.
