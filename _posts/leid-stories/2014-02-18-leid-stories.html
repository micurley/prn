No Safe Ground In ‘Stand-Your-Ground’ — In Florida &amp; 24 Other States 
Florida was the first state to enact a “Stand<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Your Ground” law (2005), but 24 other states now enforce statutes similar to Florida Statute 776.<br />
013 (3).
<br />
“Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
, following yesterday’s discussion of the Michael Dunn case—in which Dunn was acquitted on a first-degree murder charge for killing Jordan Davis, 18, after a heated argument over loud music coming from an SUV Davis and three others were in—discusses the origins of the “Stand Your Ground” law.
<br />
Maddox places Stand Your Ground and similar laws in the context of the Slave Codes, Jim Crow law of the Deep South, the duality of natural rights vs civil rights, and racial re-entrenchment.<br />
