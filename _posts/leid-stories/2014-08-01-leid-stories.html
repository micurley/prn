To Free Your Mind, Give Us A Piece of It!
What a week! It’s as if the whole world went mad.
<!--more-->
Scary thing is, it looks like more of the same is headed our way next week.
<br />
Hence, the importance of “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories. <br />
This is the day we decode and share our thoughts about what has happened, and brace ourselves for what’s likely to come. <br />
 
Add your own flavor to this zesty intellectual soup with your take on major issues and events. <br />
Or, fix our gaze on something else entirely. <br />
It’s your call; you decide where the conversation ought to go.
<br />
Call 888-874-4888 and be heard!<br />
