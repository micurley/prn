Mosby announced the indictment and arrest of six police officers allegedly connected to the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old local man, while in their custody after an illegal arrest April 12.<br />
Gray, who suffered a severed spinal cord and crushed voice box among other injuries, died a week later. <br />

Maddox Jr. <br />
