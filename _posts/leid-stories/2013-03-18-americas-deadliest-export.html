In a wide-ranging interview with Leid Stories, Blum expounds on the theme of his latest book—that America’s superpower status is directly linked to actions it undertakes against other countries that are so antidemocratic, wrongheaded and deadly, they make the regimes of so-called “rogue” nations look like amateurs. <br />
