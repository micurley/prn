defensive yesterday, trying to explain why his agency got it wrong about the panic-inducing “blizzard of historic proportions” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday would dump about three feet of snow on New York City. <br />
That didn’t happen. <br />
(Uccellini said the NWS wasn’t wrong, really, it just should have done a better job of communicating that the projected hit on the city was iffy.<br />
)
What did happen, though, was that the city was placed under full state-of-emergency management and operation, including a total shutdown of public transportation, a travel ban, and even a curfew that carried a threat of fines.

De Blasio, Gov. <br />
Andrew Cuomo and disaster-preparedness officials are generally quite pleased with how things worked out. <br />
Leid Stories discusses why people should be very, very concerned.
<br />
We also look at other snow jobs—“news” stories that simply won’t tell us what we need to know.<br />
