In the Matters of Ferguson, MO: The Unseen Legal Battles Over Rights
Detroit: Yet Another Round of Court for Activists<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Wanting Their City Back
Two months since Ferguson, Missouri, erupted in protest over the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Police Officer Darren Wilson, and the small predominantly African American city remains taut and on edge as it tries to reassemble itself with a template of its own making. <br />
Meanwhile, the old one still is in effect, and it continues to wreak havoc.
<br />
Tony Rothert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, discusses cases his office has litigated that provide a snapshot of the root of long-simmering tensions in Ferguson and in other communities of color across the state.
<br />
Without even a functioning court in their forced-into-bankruptcy city to hear their case, a group of activists must travel an hour out of town to Ingham County Circuit Court to legally challenge the state’s takeover and decimation of Detroit’s public-school system.
<br />
Elena Herrada, a member of the Detroit School Board and an activist with Detroiters Resisting Emergency Management, gives an update on their third battle with the state.<br />
