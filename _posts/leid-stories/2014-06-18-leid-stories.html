Faith leaders from all over Florida are converging on Tallahassee today for a faceoff with the state’s Board of Executive Clemency seeking to restore the voting rights of an estimated 1.<br />
5 million ex-felons barred permanently from voting because of their criminal past. <br />

British Pakistani scholar-journalist Tariq Ali with surgical precision places the current crisis in Iraq in political and historical context in a prescient speech he delivered at Binghamton University 10 years ago.
<br />
Tariq’s talk was based on his new book at the time, “Bush In Babylon: The Recolonization of Iraq.” <br />
