Voting: Young People Are Opting Out. Is It Time to Just Say No?
<!--more-->
‘Historic’ March for Climate Change, But A Troubling Atmosphere
A study earlier this year by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics found that young Americans 18 to 29 years old aren’t interested in voting.
<br />
Only 23 percent of participants said they plan to vote in November. <br />
Their trust in government is “at a five-year low” and “their cynicism toward the political process has never been higher,” and they’re opting out of voting, said IOJ director Trey Grayson. <br />
Interestingly, disillusionment with politics was more prevalent among Democratic participants, but Conservatives and Republicans were most enthusiastic about the midterm and November elections, the study found.
<br />
Young people aren’t the only demographic turned off by politics in general, and the Obama administration in particular. <br />
So, will opting out catch on this November and beyond?
<br />
It certainly was historic. <br />
As many as 400,000 people, according to news reports, coursed through midtown Manhattan yesterday in the People’s Climate March in vivid demand for world action on measures to curb global warming. <br />
The United Nations tomorrow hosts a preliminary climate summit that will lay out an agenda for a major international conference next year in Paris.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses the climate-change march and why so much about it was and is troubling. <br />
