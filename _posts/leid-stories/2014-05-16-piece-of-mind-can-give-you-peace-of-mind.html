What a week!
<!--more-->
So much has happened where you live, across the nation and around the world, it’s enough to make you lose your mind. <br />
But don’t. <br />
It’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories—the perfect antidote to mental meltdown.
<br />
Let’s hear your thoughts and opinions on issues and events that mattered this week, or on any other subject you think warrants special attention. <br />
Here there’s no “right” or “wrong” way of seeing the world; we’re interested in the logic and integrity of your position and, truth be told, a sense of humor while we banter.
<br />
The main task, you see, is to vent with purpose. <br />
This way, we declutter, recalibrate and ready ourselves for a great weekend with family and friends.<br />
