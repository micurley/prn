Twenty-one states are not expanding their Medicaid<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
programs, and four have not yet decided. <br />

“Shop &amp; Frisk” points up two unpleasant issues – Black “leaders” who intentionally   soften the blow against offending stores, and black consumers who have little or no understanding of their economic power.
