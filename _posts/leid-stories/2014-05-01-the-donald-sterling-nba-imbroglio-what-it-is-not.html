being made to look like a brand-new main attraction. <br />
This revamped version quickly identifies “the problem” and assigns blame; gives us a hero (as counterpoint to the villain), who takes resolute action; gives everyone warm and fuzzy feelings about “justice” and “the right thing” being done; and, most importantly, returns life to the good old status quo.
<br />
The awful truth, though, is that it’s all a charade—a cheap, tawdry chapter in the continuing saga of racism in America. <br />
Worse, the people facilitating it, pliantly playing their roles, will be the biggest losers in this high-stakes drama. <br />
And yet another exquisite opportunity to effect meaningful, longstanding change will be lost to expediency and the unwillingness or inability to see beyond self.

Leid Stories continues its commentary. <br />
Listeners contribute their thoughts.<br />
