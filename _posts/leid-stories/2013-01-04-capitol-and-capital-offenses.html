It’s official: Old-style politics reigns once again on Capitol Hill.
<!--more-->
John Boehner, re-elected overlord of the House, swears off any one-on-one meetings with the also re-elected Barack Obama and everyone toes the line while vying for choice committee assignments. <br />
Leid Stories also takes a look at the different treatment and outcomes for the perpetrators of two mass killings — James Eagan Holmes (Aurora, Colo.<br />
, July 20, 2012 ) and Colin Ferguson (Long Island Railroad, NY, Dec. <br />
7, 1993).
