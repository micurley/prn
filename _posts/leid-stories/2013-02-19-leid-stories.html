Listeners debate two issues.
<br />
Are Republicans on the side of right when they claim a “massive coverup” on Benghazi and therefore entitled to interrupt or obstruct the business of government in pursuit of mere allegations? <br />
Or, is their way of continuing the do-nothing strategy of Obama’s first term so he would have little to show as accomplishments for his two terms in office?
<br />
And, in terms of the law, how is Christopher Dorner to be classified, given his actions and his own justification for them in his “manifesto?<br />
”  Was he mentally impaired by racism? <br />
Is racism a viable defense for murder? <br />
With his “declaration of war” as a former cop against the LAPD, was he an assassin, an enemy combatant, a megalomaniac who felt entitled to take summary action because things did not go his way? <br />
