No Justice, No Pleas: No Rape Charges Against Sharpton Lawyer Cut from Garner Case
Brown, Garner Cases Suggest<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Accommodation, Not Litigation Against System
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. <br />
said yesterday that a three-month-long investigation into charges by a female executive of the Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton’s National Action Network that she was sexually assaulted by the lawyer Sharpton had selected to handle litigation of the Eric Garner chokehold case against the NYPD proved her charges baseless. <br />
Sanford Rubenstein, a prominent attorney, said he was pleased that he was “fully cleared.<br />
” Sharpton, who cut Rubenstein from the case when the charges were filed against him, has said nothing of Vance’s decision. <br />
In 2012, Vance vindicated former IMF chief Dominique Strauss Kahn of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper, saying she wasn’t “credible.<br />
” Kahn, a presidential hopeful in France, later settled a civil suit by Nafissatou Diallo.
<br />
The Rubenstein saga revives questions about the tactics Sharpton and his legal teams have taken in two major cases that are at the root of nationwide justice and anti-police brutality movements—the chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, NY on July 17 last year, and the shooting death of Michael Brown on Aug. <br />
9 in Ferguson, Missouri, both involving police.
<br />
 Leid Stories says Sharpton and his legal teams are accommodating with the systems they are supposed to be litigating against. <br />
Large settlements, not justice, are what they’re after.<br />
