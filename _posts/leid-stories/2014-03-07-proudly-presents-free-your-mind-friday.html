title: Proudly Presents “Free Your Mind Friday”
---
Well, here we are, by popular demand, at the premiere of “Free Your Mind Friday!
<!--more-->

It’s a re-branded, re-scheduled “Open Forum,” but with the same purpose and intent—to be the gathering place for the vigorous exchange of information, opinions and ideas.<br />
”
Leid Stories’ listeners had everything to do with it. <br />
Fridays (as opposed to Tuesdays) allow for a review of the week’s major issues, they said, and they liked “Sarah from Dallas”’s idea of having an opportunity to exorcise burdensome thoughts before the weekend. <br />
Mission accomplished on both counts.
<br />
So, free your mind. <br />
Let’s hear what you have to say about whatever you think is worth [re]considering.  <br />
