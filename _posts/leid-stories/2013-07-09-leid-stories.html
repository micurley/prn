Let’s Hear What You Have to Say! It’s Open Forum!
<!--more-->
It can’t be the case that with all the news we’ve been inundated with lately, you have no opinion, nothing to say, about the major issues of the day. <br />
Or, maybe what you think is important has nothing to do with the news. <br />
Either way, here’s a chance to speak your mind.
<br />
It’s Open Forum on Leid Stories—the gathering place for the exchange of information, opinions and ideas.
<br />
Share your thoughts, but expect to hear differences of opinion–offered with great respect, of course!
<br />
Stay sane! <br />
Defrag you brain! <br />
