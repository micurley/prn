title: Free Your Mind and Help Free the World!
---
It’s Friday.
<!--more-->
On Leid Stories, it’s when freeing your mind helps to free the world.
<br />
Masterfully dissect a major news issue or event, take us through your reasoning, and hear the shackles fall. <br />
Or, brace yourself for an equally masterful retort. <br />
Either way, minds are set free, and the doers of such good deeds earn a grand prize indeed—the satisfaction of knowing that they have done honorable trade in the marketplace of opinions and ideas.
<br />
Now, live for the weekend and prosper!<br />
