Hillary’s State Department OK’d $48 Million In Gigs for Bill
 
A small political action committee, Wolf-PAC, had a big idea—ending corporate financing of political campaigns nationwide. <br />
It organized a grassroots campaign to persuade at least 34 states to support a Free and Fair Elections Amendment to the US Constitution. <br />
In May, Vermont was the first to sign on. <br />
And now California is on board.<br />
 Todd Jagger, a Wolf-PAC coordinator, talks about getting 32 more states.

Leid Stories introduces Brazilian journalist Pepe Escobar, renowned for his authoritative reporting on crises in the world’s major trouble spots. <br />
He discusses the wholesale surrender of the media to geopolitical considerations and corporate interests, fulfilling its primary role as creators of an alternate reality. <br />
Escobar, whose latest book is Globalistan: How the Globalized World is Dissolving into Liquid War, takes us into the world he knows very well.
<br />
Judicial Watch, reviewing documents it obtained via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit last year against the State Department, discovered 48 million [more] reasons the Clintons should be doing prison time. <br />
While Hill was secretary of state, Bill was able to wrangle $48 million in fees for speaking engagements and high-profile appearances at events unrelated to the State Department and that were clear-cut breaches of ethics rules. <br />
Leid Stories asks: The Clintons and ethics?
