The Brian Williams Brouhaha: Lies, Money and Media Hypocrisy
NBC News anchor Brian Williams is laying low for a while,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
hoping that an internal probe won’t unearth more of his “misremembered” stories.
<br />
Bigwigs at NBC are furious that their $10-million-a-year “NBC Nightly News” gatekeeper has tarnished the organization’s “credibility” with at least two stories. <br />
Williams said he was in a helicopter in Iraq in 2003 that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. <br />
And he said he saw a body or bodies float by his gang-ravaged French Quarter hotel in the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
<br />
Iraq War veterans and New Orleans emergency officials have called Williams out on both counts, totally disputing Williams’ accounts.
<br />
Leid Stories in a commentary dissects the brouhaha over Williams, which provides an excellent opportunity to explore the real issue here: Brian Williams’ lies pale in comparison to the lies routinely told by NBC and corporate media in general.
<br />
The corporate media, however, don’t have a monopoly on lies, warns Leid Stories.<br />
