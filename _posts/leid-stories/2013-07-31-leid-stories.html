Edward Snowden &amp; The Prism of Whiteness
It’s enough, in many quarters, that Edward Snowden has disemboweled Prism,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
the NSA’s massive cybersurveillance program, and is serving up its entrails at his whim on silver platters for the whole world to see. <br />
 He’s hit Big Brother where it really hurts. <br />
He’s recalibrated the power equation between the government and the governed. <br />
He’s a world-class hero, worthy of unqualified, no-questions-asked, global support.
<br />
Leid Stories takes a look at Snowden, his actions and expressed beliefs and the current situation through the prism that shapes his world—the prism of whiteness. <br />
It is an undemocratic world that negates certain realities and histories while arrogating onto itself the “natural” power and “right” to reorder and reshape things to its own liking. <br />
People of color in the United States and all around the world know this story only too well.
