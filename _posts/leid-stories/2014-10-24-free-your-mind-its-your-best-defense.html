title: Free Your Mind! It’s Your Best Defense!
---
Here you are at the end of a very trying week, and you’re in relatively good shape. Good for you!
<!--more-->
You’ve triumphed over the conspiracy to drive you mad with a torrent of “news” and “information” designed mostly to confuse you, throw you off kilter, and dumb you down.
<br />
Defend your most precious asset—your facile mind, your ability to think things through!
<br />
Disassemble the mishmash we’ve been fed all week and offer instead a pristine analysis of what we really ought to know. <br />
Say no to mentacide! <br />
Free your mind!
<br />
Call 888-874-4888 and start the process.<br />
