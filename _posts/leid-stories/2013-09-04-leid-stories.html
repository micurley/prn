Now, How About A Nice Little War?
<!--more-->
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, responding to President Obama’s urgent call for congressional approval to use force against Syria, held a hearing yesterday, with three of the administration’s top officials – Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Secretary of State John Kerry and Gen. <br />
Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – making the case for punitive military action against Bashar al-Assad’s regime for allegedly using chemical weapons on Aug. <br />
21 to wipe out several rebel strongholds just outside of Damascus.
<br />
With a level of bipartisan productivity not seen in five years, the committee by the end of the day hammered out a draft resolution backing Obama’s request. <br />
To be debated next week when legislators return after recess, it sets a time limit of 60 days on any military operation; says the operation must be “limited and tailored” in the use of the US armed forces; and bans the use of troops in the war-torn country.
<br />
Leid Stories explores with listeners the significance of the committee’s action and the likely impact/fallout among Americans and the world community of nations.<br />
