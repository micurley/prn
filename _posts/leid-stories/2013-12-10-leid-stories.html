Step Up and State Your Case! It’s Open Forum on Leid Stories!
<!--more-->
 
Opine, debate, theorize, refute, declare, comment, oppose, criticize, proclaim, defend – whatever your sentiments about news issues and events (or something entirely different), bring them to Open Forum, the gathering place for the exchange of information, opinions and ideas, and share them with the sharpest minds on the planet.
<br />
You get to take the conversation wherever you want it to go. <br />
But be prepared for very close questioning, immediate reaction and countervailing points of view – offered with great respect, of course. <br />
