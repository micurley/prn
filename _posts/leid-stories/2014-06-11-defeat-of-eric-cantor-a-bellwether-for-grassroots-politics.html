a spectacular end the career of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, capturing Virginia’s heavily Republican 7th Congressional District in the primary election.
<br />
Few saw the possibility of Brat getting 55 percent of the vote, or that the same conservative movement that in 2001 brought Cantor in would also take him out. <br />

Brat’s win has energized the movement within the Republican Party to reshape, redefine and reconstitute itself with respect to the needs and interests of its political base and core constituencies. <br />
In many ways, says Leid Stories, it should serve as a bellwether for grassroots political action, encouraging the emergence of a vigorous, committed, people-centered alternative to Democratic Party co-optation and betrayal.  <br />
