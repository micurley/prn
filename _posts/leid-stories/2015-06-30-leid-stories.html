U.S. Supreme Court Decisions 2015: ‘Not All Settled Law’
The U.S.
<!--more-->
Supreme Court has wrapped up its term with a bumper crop of history-making decisions. <br />
The court may have settled several controversial matters of law, but it also has triggered questions about the politicization of the justices and their seemingly limitless authority as the last word on laws enacted by Congress and presidential action.
<br />
Josh Blackman, an assistant professor of law at the South Texas College of Law and an expert on constitutional law, the US Supreme Court, and the intersection of law and technology, discusses key decisions of the court’s term.
<br />
Author of Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare, Blackman deconstructs the court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act. <br />
