Motown’s Katrina: The Secret Bankruptcy Plans for Detroit’s Public Schools
A trial to determine whether the City of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Detroit will be given official clearance under federal bankruptcy laws to proceed with its draconian restructuring plan enters its second week. <br />
It’s the final phase of legal wrangling over whether Kevyn Orr, the state-imposed emergency manager for the city, has proven a purported $18 billion in debt, has worked out agreements with creditors on how much they will be paid and terms of payment, and has a credible plan for putting the city back on solid, long-term fiscal footing.
<br />
Detroit’s bankruptcy, the largest for a municipality in US history, has drawn national and international attention, because it was the world-renowned center of US automobile manufacturing.
<br />
Two guests on Leid Stories today will discuss a major intended consequence of Detroit’s bankruptcy—the evisceration of its public school system, which is already in progress. <br />
Hurricane Katrina was used to shut down New Orleans’ public schools (charter schools now are fully in charge of education there); bankruptcy is being used to shutter Detroit’s schools, they say.
<br />
Elena Herrada, a member of the Detroit School Board and an activist with Detroiters Resisting Emergency Management, says that school properties have already been turned over to real estate interests and are a key part of the city’s “rebirth” plan. <br />
Shutting down and selling off public schools “is how they’re emptying neighborhoods,” she says.
<br />
Dr Thomas C. <br />
Pedroni, associate professor of curriculum studies and policy sociology at Wayne State University and director of the Detroit Data and Democracy Project, predicted Detroit’s schools’ “Katrina moment” years ago. <br />
The race-based changes in education in post-Katrina New Orleans and now-bankrupt Detroit cannot be ignored, he says.<br />
