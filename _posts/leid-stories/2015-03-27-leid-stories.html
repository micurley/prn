Talk Takes Center Stage at Leid Stories’ “Family Reunion”
It’s a family reunion on Leid Stories!  We’re together again!
<!--more-->
We’ve had a too-long dry spell, unable to connect with each other and talk about the issues of the day. <br />
Well,  the tech and wiring wizards have done their thing, and we’re good to go while PRN prepares to move into its new home.<br />
 This, of course, means we have some making up to do for all those “Free Your Mind Fridays” that went poof. <br />
Well, it starts today.<br />
Share the joy of reconnecting with the Leid Stories family. <br />
Pick up the phone and pick up from where you left off. <br />
Call 888-874-4888 and give us a piece of your mind.<br />
