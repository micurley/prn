A Speech As History: Obama’s—and Our—Date with Destiny
President Obama briefs congressional leaders today on his plans<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

for military action against the Islamic State—a leadup to his much-anticipated speech to the nation (and to the world) tomorrow on the same subject.
<br />
Numbed as we’ve been by Obama’s political speeches, we’re inclined to think this will be yet another of his droll addresses, heavy on cadence and light on content. <br />
But we’d be wrong. <br />
For, whatever the content of Obama’s speech, its historicity and the gravity of its impact will be most important. <br />
The nation and the world dramatically will be changed by it.
<br />
Leid Stories focuses our attention on the context of Obama’s speech, with listeners providing a broad understanding of the moment we’re in and how, in a visceral way, his address brings us all to a definitive, intertwined, unavoidable point of reckoning.
<br />
Sounds esoteric, but it’s good old-fashioned political theory and analysis.<br />
