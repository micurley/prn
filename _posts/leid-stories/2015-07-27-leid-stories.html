Shared Agendas: Trump’s Media-Aided Meteoric Rise
In Memory of Sandra Bland: A Requiem for All of Us
Just six weeks<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
after announcing his candidacy, Donald Trump is leading the pack of 16 Republican presidential contenders and closing in on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to public-opinion polls.
<br />
Leid Stories explains Trump’s meteoric political rise.
<br />
Funeral services were held Saturday for Sandra Bland, the 28-year-old woman who was found dead in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas, on July 13, 2015, three days after being arrested for failing to signal when changing lanes. <br />
State and federal investigations into her death continue; local medical examiners, however, have said she died from “self-inflicted asphyxiation.<br />
”
Official focus predictably has centered on Bland’s alleged suicide to expunge itself of blame. <br />
But her death and the chain of events that led up to it are deeply rooted in a history we know all too well, says Leid Stories. <br />
