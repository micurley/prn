Puerto Rico’s Crisis: Debt Peonage and 21st-Century U.S. Colonialism
Dr. Victor M.
<!--more-->
Rodriguez, professor of Chicano and Latino Studies at California State University of Long Beach, explains Puerto Rico’s current $73-billion debt crisis in the context of the island’s political status as a US colony and the suitability of its continued indebtedness to US and international financial interests, and governance by leaders in collusion with both. <br />
 

Born in Puerto Rico, Rodriguez’s area of expertise is the racialization of Latino identity and its impact on political behavior. <br />
At CSULB he teaches courses emphasizing issues in social inequality: Wealth and Poverty in Latino Communities, Chicano/Latino Politics, and on Identity Assimilation in Chicano and Latino Life, The Ethnic Experience, and Latino Population in the United States. He is the author of Latino Politics: Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class in the Mexican American and Puerto Rican Experience in the United States (2012).<br />
