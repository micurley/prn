The IRP6 &amp; the FBI, Chapter 5: Bogus Trial, Bogus Verdicts
Listeners Ask Questions About This Unusual Case
 
Leid<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Stories concludes last week’s (Feb. <br />
19) discussion of the trial of six executives (the IRP6) of an African American-owned software company who on June 9, 2009 saw their Colorado City offices raided by 21 armed FBI agents and boxes of intellectual and other property taken under a warrant alleging fraud.
<br />
Investigative Resource Planning Solutions (IRP) was a sham operation and engaging in fraud because it racked up substantial balances with several IT staffing firms for help in creating software products that didn’t exist, a 25-count federal indictment charged, although a previous grand jury had found the same charges to be totally without merit.
<br />
A trial that can only be described as bizarre resulted in convictions of the six men, who currently are serving terms of up to 11 years. <br />
 
The IRP6 maintain that the raid, indictment and trial were designed to shut the company out of multimillion-dollar government contracts the company was on the verge of getting with an innovative software solution it designed and, eventually, to shut the company down permanently. <br />
 
Listeners ask questions of two guests who worked at IRP and now are with A Just Cause, an organization seeking the release of the IRP6 and a full federal investigation of the case.<br />
