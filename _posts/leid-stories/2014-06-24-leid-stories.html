Obama Re-engineered As Touchstone for ‘Real’ Leadership, ‘New’ Ideas
Israeli Activist Says Zionism, Like Apartheid,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Must Be Dismantled
It’s been subtle. <br />
It’s been blatant. <br />
And it’s been ratcheted up—the deliberate re-engineering of President Barack Obama and what will become not only the narrative of his eight-year tenure, but also a more precise revision of the race-based codas that govern life in the United States.
<br />
Leid Stories explains how a consortium of interests, sharing historical rights and privileges that temporarily (though minimally) have been disrupted by Obama’s election and presidency, are busy realigning and re-entrenching their values. <br />
Sadly, the engineered president is cooperating.
<br />
Israeli American activist Miko Peled, a former captain in the Israeli Defense Force whose grandfather, Avraham Katznelson, was one of the founders of the Zionist state, and whose father, Mattityahu Peled, was an army general who became a leading voice for a negotiated peace with the Palestine Liberation Organization, explains why Zionism must be dismantled.
