From Watts to Washington, Any Lessons Learned?
<!--more-->
On this day 38 years ago, South Central Los Angeles was in its second day of a continuous volcanic eruption that transfixed the nation and the world. <br />
Touched off by alleged police misconduct in the arrest of a local man for speeding and an officer’s club “accidentally” striking a witness of the arrest, the Watts area became a veritable war zone. <br />
By the third day, when a contingent of military units quelled the uprising, 34 people were dead and property damage was assessed at $35 million.<br />
The Watts rebellion ignited mirror explosions all over America up until July 28, 967, when President Lyndon B. <br />
Johnson impaneled a National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the task of which was to answer three questions: What happened? <br />
Why did it happen? <br />
What can be done to prevent it from happening again?<br />
Leid Stories today asks: From Watts to Washington, any lessons learned?
