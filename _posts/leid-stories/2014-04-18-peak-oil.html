Peak Oil: What You Need to Know About A Looming Global Crisis
Hell In Hanford, WA: America’s Most Contaminated<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Nuclear Site
Leid Stories listener Jay Smith, an environmental activist, presents an FYI, “Peak Oil: The Basics on A Looming Global Crisis.<br />
” 
Recently launched as a “peer-to-peer teaching and learning” component of the program, FYIs are briefings or primers on subjects deserving further study and discussion.
<br />
Investigative reporter Paul DeRienzo, working under a Polk Awards journalism grant, files the first installment of “America’s Fukushima”–a series on a longstanding ecological disaster caused by massive contamination from the Hanford Site, a sprawling nuclear-reactor complex on the Columbia River in south-central Washington state.
<br />
The now-decommissioned site, built in 1943, housed the world’s first plutonium-production reactor that produced much of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the nuclear bombs used against Japan. <br />
But the operation of its nine reactors, phased out between 1968 and 1987, has created one of the largest ecological disasters in the United States.
