The IRP6 &amp; the FBI, Chapter 3: A Blizzard of Federal Charges
 
On June 9, 2009, four years and four months after<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
their offices were raided by 21 armed FBI agents, six executives of Investigative Resource Planning Solutions (IRP Solutions)—David A. <br />
Banks, Demetrius K. <br />
Harper, Gary L. <br />
Walker, Clinton A. <br />
Stewart, David S. <br />
Zirpolo and Kendrick Barnes—found themselves facing 25 counts each on federal conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud charges.
<br />
But it was the second time federal prosecutors convened a grand jury to consider the charges. <br />
A grand jury was convened on Feb. <br />
6, 2007, but unanimously found no reason to indict. <br />
Bent on a conviction in the case, federal prosecutors convened another grand jury the following month and got what they wanted—an indictment.
<br />
Leid Stories delves into the unusual legal maneuverings that produced the charges and that raise serious questions about the possible violation of the defendants’ constitutional rights. <br />
