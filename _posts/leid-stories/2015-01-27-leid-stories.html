Snowed!: Pre-empted by the “Blizzard of Historic Proportions”
Leid Stories will not air live today.
<!--more-->
With short notice, a state of emergency has been declared in New York City, where PRN is headquartered, owing to a blizzard that is said to be heading toward the area. <br />
Public transportation, including the entire subway system, will be shut down, roads and highways will be closed, and people are to be off the streets by 11 pm
Our wonderful engineers, anticipating the weather emergency might extend to tomorrow, are airing rebroadcasts of shows for those programs, like Leid Stories, that are live—just in case they’re not able to get back to the studios tomorrow.
<br />
Thanks for your understanding. <br />
Hopefully, all will be well enough to resume our normal schedule.<br />
