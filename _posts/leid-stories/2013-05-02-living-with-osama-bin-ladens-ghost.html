Navy Seals had breached the walls of a fortified compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and found and killed the FBI’s most wanted person, Osama bin Ladin. <br />
They took his body back via helicopter to a military base in Afghanistan for identification, and then buried it at sea within 24 hours.
<br />
The nation was ecstatic. <br />
The man behind the Sept. <br />
11, 2001 terrorist attacks was dead, finally dead, and not even in a blaze of glory.

Leid Stories elicits from listeners their views on the impact of terrorism on their lives and the way they see the world, now that we live with Osama bin Laden’s ghost.
