Here’s Your Chance to Free Your Mind—And Ours, Too!
<!--more-->
What a week it’s been—war, conspiracy, usurpation of democracy, corruption, terrorism, clandestine operations, lying leaders. <br />
And that’s just Washington!
<br />
Having survived yet another challenging week, what are your thoughts on the major issues that dominated the news? <br />
Or, maybe you’d like to introduce something entirely unrelated for consideration and/or debate.
<br />
It’s your call. <br />
You choose where you want the conversation to go. <br />
Offer your best, make your case, and you’ll know soon enough whether you’ve jiggled the brain cells of the world’s most discerning audience.
<br />
Now you can add your visit to the forum to your list of stellar accomplishments. <br />
And you’ve freed up enough space in your mind to fully appreciate a jazz concert this weekend.<br />
