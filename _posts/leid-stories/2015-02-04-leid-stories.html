The Great Comeback?
<!--more-->
 The Resurgence of Almost-Ex-President Barack Obama
His next-to-last year in office has started at fever pitch and with a few significant victories to claim on a loaded domestic- and foreign-policy agenda. <br />
He’s fresh-faced, energetic, self-assured and ready for a throw-down. <br />
He’s becoming more and more likeable, according to the polls, even with a more and more combative, Republican-controlled Congress.
<br />
Is this The Great Comeback, the carefully choreographed rallying of Almost-Ex-President Barack Obama, or is something else happening here?
<br />
Leid Stories listeners offer their thoughts.<br />
