So Soon After Labor Day—Another “Free Your Mind” Friday!
Time flies when you have a short week after Labor Day.
<!--more-->
Before you know it, it’s another weekend, and another “Free Your Mind” Friday to usher it in!
<br />
This short week was long on major news issues and developments. <br />
Surely a few have taken hold of your brain and won’t let go. <br />
Here’s your chance to dislodge and dispatch those little monsters.
<br />
Call in to the world’s best open forum and share your opinions and ideas. <br />
Get them out of your head, and into other people’s! <br />
Your brain will thank you by making you stress-free and truly available to those you love this weekend.
<br />
Can peace of mind really be achieved by calling 888-874-4888? <br />
Oh yes, dear friend, oh yes. <br />
And it’s good at least until Monday.
<br />

<br />
