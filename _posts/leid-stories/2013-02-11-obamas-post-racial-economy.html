title: Obama’s Post-Racial Economy
---
It will come as no surprise that President Obama will focus on the economy in his State of the Union address tomorrow —<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

and, specifically, his second-term initiatives to save “the middle class.<br />
” What Obama calls the “middle class,” though, warrants examination. <br />
Why? <br />
Because he’s not talking about two sizable constituencies that put him in the White House — African Americans and Latinos — but are suffering more than all other ethnic groups. <br />
It’s a disturbing pattern, and Leid Stories calls Obama on it.
