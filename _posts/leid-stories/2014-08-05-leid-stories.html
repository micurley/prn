Medical Examiner Rules Homicide; Chokehold Case Takes Familiar Path
Israel, International Law and Impediments to Peace<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

in Palestine
New York City’s chief medical examiner announced last Friday that Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father of six from Staten Island who died during a violent arrest by a group of police officers on July 17, was the victim of a homicide. <br />
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, had placed Garner in a chokehold—a tactical maneuver banned by the NYPD since 1993.
<br />
The case has touched off yet another wave of community outrage over police brutality, with the Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton taking the lead in calling for justice and seeking federal  intervention.
<br />
Leid Stories cites troubling signs that the case is already on the wrong course, and explains how it is following a predictable pattern that is unlikely to deliver the kind of justice the community is clamoring for.
<br />
Israel reportedly has withdrawn all troops from Gaza as a 72-hour truce goes into effect to deliver humanitarian aid to the bombarded area. <br />
Many are hoping it is the first step in a de-escalation of hostilities and a step toward brokered peace negotiations.
<br />
Richard Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University and a UN-appointed special rapporteur on Palestine, explains in a speech at the University of London how and why several attempts at negotiating peace deliberately were sabotaged.<br />
