Winds of Change in Chicago?
<!--more-->
 Rahm and “Chuy” Race to A Historic Finish
It’s the eve of a historic election in Chicago, the first time an incumbent mayor has been forced into a runoff since the city adopted nonpartisan elections 20 years ago. <br />
The Windy City bristles with anticipation about the outcome. Even as Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his challenger, Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” García, make last-ditch forays for votes,  they’re homing in on two key blocs that will determine who next occupies City Hall–undecided voters, and African American and Latino voters.<br />
 A weekend poll by Ogden &amp; Fry was showing Emanuel with an appreciable lead over García going into Tuesday. <br />
But the poll also showed large numbers of uncommitted voters, and noted that Latinos were underrepresented in its data.<br />
 Local media, also reporting a double-digit lead by Emanuel, nonetheless are hesitant to call the race because of García’s upset the first go-round on Feb. <br />
24 that forced the runoff.<br />
 Leid Stories listener Gardis H. <br />
Watts, a native Chicagoan who has been following the contentious race, provides perspective on the significance of the Emanuel-García faceoff and how it’s resonating at ground level in his home town.<br />
