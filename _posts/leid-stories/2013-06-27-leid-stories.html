Snowden Looks to Ecuador for Asylum, But Is His Petition Insane?
<!--more-->
Said by President Vladimir Putin to be holed up for a week in the diplomatic no-man’s-land of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport with no place yet to go, NSA leaker Edward Snowden is coming to terms with how lonely covert operations can sometimes be. <br />
Still, he’s managed to put the squeeze on Ecuador (already sheltering Wikileaks’ Julian Assange at its embassy in London) to hurry things up—thereby causing a faceoff between his hoped-for asylum country and the United States over “consequences” for taking him in. <br />
President Rafael Correa has terminated a trade agreement with the US, saying he will not be bullied.
<br />
Leid Stories poses the question to listeners: Is it fair of Snowden, who voluntarily chose to do what he did, to create such havoc that could adversely affect 15 million people? <br />
