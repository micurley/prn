Massacre in South Carolina: A ‘Hate Crime’ or Something Else?
<!--more-->
Rachel Dolezal and the ‘Science’ of Racial Identity
A prayer meeting Wednesday night at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the oldest AME church in the South, came to a violent end when a white gunman who was among the congregants opened fire, killing nine, including the Rev. <br />
Clementa Pinckney, pastor of the church and a member of the state Senate. <br />
Police are calling the attack a “hate crime.<br />
” But is it something else?
<br />
And now, the world of “science” chimes in on the Rachel Dolezal saga. <br />
An article published yesterday by Live Science features “experts” on ethnicity and racial identity debating whether Dolezal can “choose” an identity different from the one she was born with. <br />
Leid Stories discusses the false construct of race and identity in America as central to the science of domination and control.<br />
