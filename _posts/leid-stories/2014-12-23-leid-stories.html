Latino Officers Association Zaps PBA, NYPD on Cop Killings, Racism
Watching Their Language: When ‘Information’ Has A<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Mission
The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association’s rancorous tirades against New York City Mayor William de Blasio crested Saturday, after two police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were killed by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in an ambush shooting in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.<br />
 “There’s blood on many hands tonight. <br />
That blood on the hands starts at City Hall in the Office of the Mayor,” said PBA President Pat Lynch, who heads the nation’s largest police union.
<br />
Tony Miranda, executive chairman of the National Latino Officers Association, says Lynch, seeking reelection as PBA leader, is “out of order” to blame de Blasio for the deaths of Ramos and Liu, and out of sync with the union’s Latino membership.
<br />
Miranda discusses these and other salient issues—including the burgeoning nationwide justice movement, racism within the police department, and a pervasive lack of leadership.

Leid Stories examines media coverage of this major story and the impact it has had on the public’s perceptions and opinions. <br />
Listeners are asked to cite blatant and subtle examples of  ways in which the mission was not to inform, but to manipulate. <br />
And if so, to what end.<br />
