grand jury’s decision on whether Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department criminally will be charged with killing Michael Brown and brought to trial. <br />
It’s all to blunt criticism or responsibility for missteps in handling the case that might affect the outcome. <br />

<br />
Leid Stories turns its attention today to the biggest missteps in the case—the roles of the Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton and the lawyers he brought in to represent the family of Michael Brown. <br />
What they did, and what they failed to do, have produced the net result of the case being used to satisfy a number of hidden agendas but not the purported No. <br />

<br />
“The people’s attorney general,” Alton H. <br />
