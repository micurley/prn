arrived at its not-guilty verdict against George Zimmerman raises troubling questions.
<br />
Identified as Juror B29, the lone nonwhite juror in an exclusive interview with Nightline’s Robin Roberts spoke of her agony in voting not guilty—even though she initially had voted for conviction on the second-degree murder charge. <br />

Juror B 37, the first juror to speak publicly after the verdict, related a similar story about how confusing the law was.
