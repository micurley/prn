So, What Have We Here?
<!--more-->
 Rating Obama and His Administrations (Part 2)
Owing to the incredible response to yesterday’s program, we continue the conversation to accommodate those with profound thoughts to share.
<br />
Almost a year into his second term, President Barack Obama’s tenure can hardly be described as smooth sailing – the current crisis in Washington a case in point. <br />
The “liberal” Democrat was at a 69-percent approval rating after his first year in office (Gallup poll, Jan. <br />
22, 2009), but times have changed. <br />
Recent polls are indicating a huge loss of love for the nation’s leader.
<br />
What accounts for this?
<br />
Leid Stories conducts its own “poll” of listeners’ perceptions and analyses of Obama and his two administrations. <br />
Among other things, they will be asked whether their view of him in his second term has changed, and if so, in what way(s); what they consider his greatest achievement and his greatest failure to date; and, on a scale of 1 to 10, how they would rate his performance in office.
