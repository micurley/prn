Stay Tied to the Facts, But Free Your Mind!
<!--more-->
Well, there ought to be no shortage of well-thought-out opinions about this week’s news issues, events and developments.
<br />
Pick a topic from your extensive “What’s [Still] Grinding My Gears” menu and break it down for us. <br />
Prove that they got it wrong, but you have it right.
<br />
Of course, you’re all the more impressive when you can back up what you say, so stay tied to the facts even as you free your mind.
<br />
