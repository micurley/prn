The NSA ‘Privacy’ Hypocrisy / A Reprieve, But Not Yet Justice, for Tawana Brawley
We’ve been waterboarded yet again<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
with a new Edward Snowden inside-spy story – this one doled out to Jeff (Amazon.<br />
com magnate) Bezos’s soon-to-be-acquired Washington Post – about the US government’s insatiable appetite for minding our business without us knowing. <br />
A different riff on the same tune.
<br />
The grandpappy of all ironies is, Snowden’s drip-by-drip “exposés,” given such dramatic play by compliant media outlets he selects for dissemination of the purloined material, should actually spark a conversation not only about government’s privacy abuses, but how his tech world and its oligarchic leaders are no different; in lockstep capitalistic cooperation with government, they have given us the gift that keeps on taking: “industrial-intelligence complex.<br />
”
Plus, a personal reflection on a Virginia circuit court ruling dismissing a defamation claim against Tawana Brawley by Steven Pagones, a former assistant district attorney from Dutchess County, NY, said to be one of four white men who kidnapped and sexually assaulted the then-15-year-old over a four-day period in November 1987.
<br />
The court’s ruling is the latest legal development in the case, which Brawley and her attorney, Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr., have been blocked by state officials from bringing to trial for 26 years.<br />
