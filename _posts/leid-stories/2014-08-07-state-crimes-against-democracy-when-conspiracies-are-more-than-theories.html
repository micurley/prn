There was no legal classification for the type of crime top lawmakers in Florida committed in 2000, when they blocked a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

recount of the vote in the presidential election. <br />
But it got Lance deHaven-Smith, a professor of public administration and policy at Florida State University, to thinking that there ought to be.
<br />
In 2006, he coined the term, “State Crimes Against Democracy (SCADs),” and since then has been on a mission to codify political criminality in high office.
<br />
SCADs, deHaven-Smith says, are a particularly pernicious type of governmental corruption. <br />
Far more dangerous than “regular” corruption for personal gain, SCADs essentially are conspiratorial and anti-democratic in nature, and involve the subversion of political institutions, branches of government, and even the entire government.
<br />
Scratch a conspiracy theory, and you very likely will find SCADs, he says.
<br />
Dr deHaven-Smith, the author of 16 books, including Conspiracy Theory In America, joins Leid Stories for an eye-opening discussion on elite political criminality in the United States and the special challenges it poses in preventing and prosecuting such crimes.<br />
