French Journalist: Before Terror Attack in Paris, Rampant Racism, Anti-Arab Sentiment, and the Rise of the Rabid<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Right
One suspect has surrendered and the hunt is on for two others in a murderous attack on  the Paris-based headquarters of a satirical magazine yesterday that left 12 people dead and at least 12 others wounded.
<br />
President Francois Hollande has declared today a national day of mourning, and the attack, the second in three years against the magazine, has drawn condemnation from heads of state all over the world.
<br />
French journalist Gilbert Mercier, cofounder and editor in chief of News Junkie Post, discusses the attack in the context of France’s foreign policy, especially in the Middle East; the rise of the ultra-right in France and throughout Europe; and a virulent strain of racism and anti-immigrant and anti-Arab sentiment.<br />
