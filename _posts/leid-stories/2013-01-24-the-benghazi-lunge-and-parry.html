Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday parried most of the partisan lunges at her in consecutive House and Senate hearings on the Sept. <br />
11 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi. <br />
But Republicans managed to plant their swords where it would hurt for a long time, even into the 2016 presidential race, should Clinton decide to run: She owned responsibility for the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at the consulate, and, despite her high-profile accomplishments as the country’s top diplomat, her department was a bureaucratic mess riddled with systemic failures. <br />
