Sharpton Lawyer’s Sex-Assault Probe Revives Tawana Brawley Case
Dictator’s Death Closes One Chapter, Opens Another, In<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Haiti’s Life
The Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton has gone silent—“no comment at this time,” says his PR flak—about the allegation by a top executive of his National Action Network that she was sexually assaulted by his attorney friend Sanford Rubenstein after a star-studded 60th-birthday bash for Sharpton at the posh Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan last Wednesday.
<br />
Rubenstein, who has made millions litigating police-brutality cases literally delivered to him by Sharpton, is the lawyer for the family of Eric Garner, killed by police chokehold in Staten Island, NY, on July 17.

Leid Stories in a commentary notes several reasons why the bloviator-in-chief’s self-imposed silence and media coverage of the Rubenstein probe are stunning—and not.
<br />
The death of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier in Haiti on Saturday has set in motion a new wave of political machinations in the beleaguered country to which the ousted dictator had returned three years ago, hoping for a comeback after 25 years in exile in France.
<br />
Kim Ives, a prizewinning documentarian and editor of Haïti Liberté, a news weekly serving the Haitian diaspora, discusses the fallout.<br />
