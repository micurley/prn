Obama Discovers Ubuntu, Then Proves He Just Doesn’t Have It

The quasi-preacher cadence and tone President Obama adopts<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
when he believes he’s making history were in full effect yesterday at the massive memorial service for the world-revered Nelson Mandela. <br />
Obama’s 18-minute eulogy did its magic – not so much on the almost 100 heads of state and high-profile people (they are used to this sort of thing), but on the estimated 50,000 attendees who crammed the First National Bank Stadium in Johannesburg. <br />
The US political rock star rocked ’em! <br />
– there, and all over the televised world.
<br />
Leid Stories disassembles Obama’s speech, a huge eye opener about the president himself – chiefly, his discomfort with his African identity; his revisionism of a people’s war against European invasion and supremacy and of ubuntu, the sociopolitical philosophy that kept the spirit of freedom burning throughout Africa; his outrageous claim that Mandela benefited from being imprisoned for 27 years because it helped him focus and think; and his intolerable insinuation that he has been trying to walk in Mandela’s path.<br />
