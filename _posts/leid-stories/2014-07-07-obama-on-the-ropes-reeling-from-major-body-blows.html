title: Obama On The Ropes, Reeling From Major Body Blows
---

A Gallup poll published last week found that approval of President Barack Obama has tanked to a six-year low, with<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
only 29 percent of Americans saying he’s doing a good job. <br />
(The poll also found that only 30 percent thought well of the US Supreme Court, and a paltry 7 percent gave Congress a passing grade.<br />
)
The Gallup poll coincided with a Quinnipiac University survey that found one-third of American voters rated Obama the worst US president since World War II. <br />
Obama’s presidency began its downward spiral even before the halfway point of his first term.
<br />
Polls, of course, are not objective, nor are they necessarily fact-based. <br />
But they are useful indicators of attitudes, opinions and varying interpretations of reality, and, often, reasonable predictors of behavior and action.
<br />
With this in mind, Leid Stories conducts its own poll today, asking listeners to rate Obama; identify the cause(s) of the president’s precipitous drop in popularity; whether he can rebound, and what impact, if any, the crisis of confidence in the president is having on their political attitudes and decisions this midterm election year.
