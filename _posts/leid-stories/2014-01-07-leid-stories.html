It’s Open Forum, the First Edition for 2014!
<!--more-->
You’ve been walking around with heavy thoughts that have weighed you down since last year.
<br />

Well, unburden yourself. <br />
Bring them to the gathering place for the exchange of information, opinions and ideas, and lay them before us all. <br />
You’ll feel much, much better, even if you’re asked to explain yourself – with due respect, of course!<br />
