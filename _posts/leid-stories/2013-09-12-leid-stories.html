Hubert Henry Harrison: “The Father of Harlem Radicalism”
The recent commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the March<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
on Washington for Jobs and Freedom – organized as a public consecration of “black leaders” and a showcase for the Democratic Party – purposely recast the historic 1963 protest as the day Dr Martin Luther King Jr. <br />
made his “I Have A Dream” speech.
<br />
The Harlem-born radicalism of Bayard Rustin and A. <br />
Philip Randolph, the driving forces behind the original march, terrified the political establishment (black and white) then, and still does today. <br />
Where did these men get their brazen ideas about black political power?
<br />
Leid Stories introduces the man Randolph called “The Father of Harlem Radicalism,” Hubert Henry Harrison. <br />
Our guest and guide is Dr Jeff Perry, editor of A Hubert Harrison Reader, and author of Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918.
<br />
Harrison, says Perry, “is the only person in US history to play leading roles in the largest class radical movement (socialism) and the largest race radical movement (the New Negro/Garvey movement) of his era. <br />
He is also a key link in the ideological unity of the two great trends of the Civil Rights/Black Liberation Struggle – ie, the labor/civil rights trend associated with Randolph and King, and the race/nationalist trend associated with Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X.”<br />
