Hubert Henry Harrison: The ‘Father of Harlem Radicalism’ – Part 2
Dr. Jeffrey B.
<!--more-->
Perry, editor of A Hubert Harrison Reader and author of Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918, concludes his presentation on this brilliant, self-taught intellectual and radical activist—“the only person in US history to play leading roles in the largest class radical movement (socialism) and the largest race radical movement (the New Negro/Garvey movement) of his era,” says Perry.
<br />
Harrison also is a key link in the ideological unity of the two great trends of Black struggle in the United States — the labor/civil rights trend associated with leaders such as A. <br />
Philip Randolph and Dr Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />
, and the race/nationalist trend associated with Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X.
<br />
Perry discusses Harrison’s insistence that Blacks develop a consciousness about the universality and interrelatedness of their struggles, and the fire he drew from black bourgeois intellectuals. <br />
Plus, listeners’ questions.<br />
