Which Way Forward?
<!--more-->
 Changing Course in America
Today marks the 50th-anniversary month of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. <br />
On Aug. <br />
28, 1963, more than 200,000 people delivered a demand in person to the government to end political, social and economic apartheid in America. <br />
Two landmark pieces of legislation, the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965), grew out of the march.
<br />
There is a general sense among Americans today that government is a failing, or failed, institution—either unwilling or unable to erase the same fissures that run deep into America’s landscape. <br />

Leid Stories asks the question: Which way forward?
