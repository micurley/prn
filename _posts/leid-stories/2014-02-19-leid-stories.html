The IRP6 &amp; the FBI, Chapter 4: Trial &amp; Tribulation
 
Leid Stories continues its report on the case of six<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
executives of a small Colorado City-based software company, Investigative Resource Planning Solutions (IRP Solutions), who inexplicably found themselves and their company targeted by federal authorities just when they were about to land multimillion-dollar contracts with law-enforcement agencies with a case-management system they created.
<br />
Twenty-one armed FBI agents raided the minority-owned company on Feb. <br />
9, 2005 under a warrant that said IRP Solutions was a sham and was engaging in fraud. <br />
They removed several boxes of “evidence,” including computer equipment and intellectual property. <br />
Federal prosecutors on Feb. <br />
6, 2007 sought a grand jury indictment on fraud and conspiracy charges, but the grand jury found no reason to indict. <br />
In a highly unusual move, prosecutors convened a second grand jury on June 9, 2009, and obtained a 25-count indictment on each of the six men, charging them with conspiracy, mail and wire fraud.
<br />
The legal twists and turns in this case become more and more outrageous and bizarre as the IRP6 come to trial – the focus of our program today.<br />
