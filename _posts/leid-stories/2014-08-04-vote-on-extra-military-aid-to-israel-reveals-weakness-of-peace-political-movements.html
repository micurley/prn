title: Vote on Extra Military Aid to Israel Reveals Weakness of Peace, Political Movements
---
On top of the $3.1 billion Israel receives each year in military aid (in lump sum—the only nation receiving U.S.
<!--more-->
aid on such terms), Congress approved an additional $504 million requested by President Obama (through the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act) for its missile and anti-rocket systems.
<br />
Last Friday, before Congress recessed for an additional month of legislative inaction, the Senate unanimously approved an additional $225 million in military aid for Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system. <br />
The House responded equally generously with a 395-8 vote approving the measure.
<br />
Clearly, Israel continues to get what it wants, and on terms that it wants, few if any questions asked. <br />
But who in Congress is asking questions? <br />
More importantly, who is compelling the asking of questions?
<br />
Friday’s vote is bad news on many levels. <br />
It proves the absolute capitulation of the White House to Israel; the ineffectiveness of whatever is passing for a peace movement; the cooptation/sellout of allegedly progressive forces in Congress; and, yet again, the need for grassroots movements to develop viable political alternatives to the Democrats and Republicans, two wings of a flightless bird.  <br />
