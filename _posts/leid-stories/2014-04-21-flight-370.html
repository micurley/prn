Flight 370: The Mystery Is About What’s NOT Being Said
‘Housewives’ Reality Show’s A Big Hit—By And On Black<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Forty-five days since Malaysia Airline Flight MH370 vanished less than an hour after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and, authorities said, ended in the churning waters of the southern Indian Ocean, an international search for the wreckage has yielded nothing.
<br />
US media have been covering the evolving story of the disappearance of MH370, with CNN outmatching them all with almost nonstop coverage, presenting just about every possible angle to the story. <br />
Like the wreckage, however, perhaps the most significant angle to the story has not yet been located. <br />
 Leid Stories reveals what it is.
<br />
It’s been a big hit for Bravo/NBC Universal from Season 1, and Season 6’s wrapup of The Real Housewives of Atlanta (Part 1 of 2) was an even bigger hit—by and on African American women. <br />
There they were, six of them all gussied up, reviewing a season of shame and pathology. <br />
And soon enough, an intergenerational weave-yanking brawl breaks out on set. <br />
Great TV! <br />
Leid Stories discusses the roles of these women in contributing to the stereotypes of African Americans.<br />
