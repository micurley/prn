Mass Water Shutoffs, Ouster of City Manager Top Detroiters’ Concerns
A Settlement In Police-Brutality Case, But The<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Matter Isn’t Settled
The federal trial to determine whether Detroit’s bankruptcy-exit plan is fair and feasible resumed this week after a one-week pause to allow Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.<br />
, the largest creditor, to meet with the city and mediators on a possible settlement deal.
<br />
But Judge Steven Rhodes began hearing testimony from angry Detroiters vehemently opposed to Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr’s draconian and arbitrary measures. <br />
Their objections, especially over extreme economic hardship, foreclosures and mass water shutoffs under Orr, are echoing beyond the courtroom; Detroiters want him gone by tomorrow, when his 18-month term ends.
<br />
Abayomi Azikiwe, our correspondent on Detroit’s bankruptcy, provides an update on the multipronged battle.
<br />
The City of Los Angeles last night settled a lawsuit by Marlene Pinnock, the woman seen on video being brutally beaten by California Highway Patrol Officer Daniel Andrew on the side of a freeway on July 1.
<br />
Leid Stories explains why the $1.5 million settlement shouldn’t mean that the matter is settled. <br />
