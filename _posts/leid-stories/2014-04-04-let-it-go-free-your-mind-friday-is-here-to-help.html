title: Let It Go! ‘Free Your Mind Friday’ Is Here to Help!
---
It’s Friday—either the end of a rough week (good), or the start of an even rougher weekend (not so much).
<!--more-->
Which do you choose? <br />
Do you remain mentally mired in media muck, or do you cut the chain around your brain?
<br />
Excellent choice! <br />
Let it go, and reap the reward of some quiet time to reconstitute yourself. <br />
Call 888-874-4888 and share with likeminded folk the thoughts about major news events that you’ve been holding on to all week. <br />
Yes, that’s why there’s “Free Your Mind Friday.”<br />
