police practice that overwhelmingly targets African American and Latino males.
<br />
The trial venue is New York City, where men of color accounted for 83% of more than 531,000 such actions last year alone. <br />
But city governments and police departments across the nation are closely monitoring the case.
<br />
The Center for Constitutional Rights and Latino Justice PRLDEF, which are representing the interests of the plaintiffs inÂ David Floyd v. <br />
City of New York, discuss with Leid Stories the salient issues in the case and the efforts by civil-rights organizations to curb escalating instances of unchecked police power.
<br />
