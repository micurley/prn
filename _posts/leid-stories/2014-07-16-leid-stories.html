Far From Settled: ‘Attorney at War Alton Maddox Seeks ‘Complete’ Justice 
In Central Park Jogger Case, Including Probe<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
of Sham Trial
 
New York City’s $40-million settlement with five Harlem men railroaded as teenagers into trials, convictions and stiff prison sentences for the 1989 rape and brutal assault of a white female jogger in Central Park is “some” justice, but not “complete” justice, says our guest, attorney Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.
<br />
Resuming the practice of law after illegally being “barred” in 1990 by an unprecedented action of the New York State Legislature, Maddox, who has litigated some of the most controversial criminal and civil-rights cases in New York City, tells Leid Stories that his top priority is reopening the case—this time to expose all the wrongs committed, assign accountability for those wrongs, and make whole all who were adversely affected by police, prosecutorial, judicial and political breach of duty and misconduct. <br />
 
Maddox, whose prowess in the courtroom has earned him the moniker “attorney at war,” represented Michael Briscoe, then 17, the only defendant to successfully challenge the state’s evidence in the case. <br />
 
He discusses in detail the basis for his intended legal action, taking calls from listeners.<br />
