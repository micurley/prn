title: It’s What You’re Not That Matters

America’s obsession about race has a fairly simple premise: Who and what you think you are aren’t nearly as important<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
as understanding who and what you are not. <br />
 Not white. <br />
 While there is intense interest in whether and to what degree the “Nots” have internalized this premise, scant attention is paid to the fact that whites are having an identity crisis all their own. <br />
Leid Stories starts that conversation.
