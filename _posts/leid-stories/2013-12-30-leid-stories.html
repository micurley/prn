The Thrill With Obama Is 62.5% Gone. What’s the Agenda for the Next Three Years?
<!--more-->
The first year of his second term completed, it is no secret that the various constituencies that delivered for President Barack Obama — twice — are less than satisfied with the yield on their political investment.
<br />
Hushed rumbling has now become sharp, open criticism as historically marginalized groups see their standard bearer unable and/or unwilling to engage fully in the battle he had promised to wage in their behalf. <br />
There is a palpable sense that he has gone to “the other side” of business-as-usual politics, doing what is expedient rather than what is necessary.
<br />
Leid Stories closes the tumultuous year assessing where things stand with the original (2008) and extended (2012) contracts between Obama and his political base, and poses the question: “What’s the agenda – his and ours — for the next three years?”   <br />
