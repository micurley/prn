U.S. Cleans Up Nuclear-Waste with â€Ś Kitty Litter!
Ferguson: A Year After Rebellion, Is There â€˜Reform?â€™
In On Feb.
<!--more-->
5, 2014, the US Department of Energy said a salt-hauling truck caught fire at its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, an underground collection, processing and storage plant for nuclear and radioactive waste from a Defense Department weapons facility located in Los Alamos, Texas. <br />
Workers were evacuated, six were treated for smoke inhalation, and part of the plant was shut down, the DOE said.
<br />
Nine days later, workers on the night shift on Feb. <br />
14 heard an explosion â€œclose to the operating location where waste was being emplaced,â€ the DOE confirmed. <br />
The next day, air monitors detected â€œvery low levels of airborne radioactive contamination.<br />
â€
Independent, award-winning journalist Paul DeRienzoâ€”who had done a six-part series (â€œAmericaâ€™s Fukushimaâ€) on Leid Stories about the nationâ€™s largest ecological disaster caused by massive contamination from the Hanford Site, a sprawling nuclear-reactor complex on the Columbia River in south-central Washington stateâ€”sheds light on the clear and present danger posed by the nationâ€™s nuclear-weapons industry and the governmentâ€™s abysmal regulation of nuclear waste.
<br />
In Ferguson, Missouri, and across the nation yesterday, thousands paused in memory of Michael Brown, who at 18 was shot dead by former police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. <br />
9 last year. <br />
Leid Stories takes a look at what Ferguson has taught us.<br />
