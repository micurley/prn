Dust Off The Cobwebs! Free Your Mind!
<!--more-->
It’s Halloween, and what’s scary is the week we’ve been through—mayhem and madness just about everywhere. <br />
But it’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories, and you can restore some degree of order and sanity to the world by putting things in perspective for us all, whether about news issues and developments that crowded in on us this week or on any subject you think merits discussion or debate.
<br />
Call in (888-874-4888) and share your thoughts with really nice people eager to hear what you have to say. <br />
You’ll be doing the scariest thing ever—helping us to dust off the cobwebs and free our minds! <br />
