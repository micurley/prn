No, it’s not a new reality show, just a new reality that seems to have taken hold of Washington, D.C.
<!--more-->
On Capitol Hill, folks are behaving badly, up to their old tricks and showing in-your-face contempt for the rule of law and violating the trust of voters. <br />
The president, too, is behaving badly, backpedaling on high-minded principles, cutting corners and calling them “compromises,” and, lately, showing a Clintonian penchant for not quite telling the truth. <br />
Bureaucrats are behaving badly, doing what’s expedient, not what’s right. <br />
And the Republicans are at war with the Democrats, even though ideologically there’s very little difference between them. <br />
Is this what we’ll be stuck with for the next four years?
