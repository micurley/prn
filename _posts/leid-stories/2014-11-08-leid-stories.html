What A Week! You Really Need to Free Your Mind!
<!--more-->
It’s been a bruiser of a week on the home front, to say the least, and the new Republican order is just getting started. <br />
Add what’s happening around the globe to the mix and it’s more than enough to drive you over the edge.
<br />
Don’t panic, all’s not lost. <br />
But it is time for a major mind cleanse. <br />
Leid Stories is here to help you free your mind.
<br />
Bring your best to “the gathering place for the exchange of information, opinions and ideas” and engage with others in vigorous discussion and debate. <br />
Add your voice, your perspective, to an unscripted, ongoing dialogue about issues and events that matter to us all. <br />
Gain new insights as you help others to do the same.<br />
