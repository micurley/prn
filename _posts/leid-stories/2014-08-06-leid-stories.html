The Other U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit: Grassroots Action in D.C.
Police Unions Defend Officers in NYC Chokehold Case;<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Blast ‘Rhetoric’
President Obama’s three-day US-Africa Leaders Summit on bilateral investment, trade and development wraps up today in Washington, DC
At Howard University, more than 150 grassroots organizations also are wrapping up a parallel summit of their own that focused on political, social, economic, environmental and human rights problems that continue to imperil the lives of millions on the continent.
<br />
(Look for discussions on the results of both summits in coming weeks.<br />
)
William Minter, editor of the AfricaFocus website and AfricaFocus Bulletin, gives an overview of the US-Africa Network’s (USAN) Empowered Africa Dialogue.
<br />
The presidents of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association yesterday excoriated “anti-police rhetoric” they said is tainting the reputation of the NYPD generally and jeopardizing the rights of police officers involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, which has been ruled a homicide.
<br />
Leid Stories and listeners deconstruct PBA President Pat Lynch’s statement as an exercise in media literacy—an ongoing Leid Stories project.
