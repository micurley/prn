Here we are, at the end of a news-riddled week.
<!--more-->
It’s impossible you don’t have an opinion about a major news story or issue that’s been in the headlines—or should have been.
<br />
Well, share it. <br />
Let’s hear it. <br />
It’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories, and the entire program is driven by listeners’ considered thoughts and opinions about any subject they choose. <br />
Folks may agree or disagree with your point of view, and that’s OK. <br />
What matters most is the integrity of your argument.
<br />
Share your intellectual wealth in a real-time forum for the exchange of information, opinions and ideas. <br />
