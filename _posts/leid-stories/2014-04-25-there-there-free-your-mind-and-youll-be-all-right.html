You’ve been told what to think about this and about that by people who don’t much about this or that.
<br />
Fortune smiles upon you. <br />
Your reward for making it through the week relatively intact is a warm welcome and genuine, good-folk fellowship at the gathering place for the exchange of information, opinions and idea.
<br />
It’s Free-Your-Mind Friday on Leid Stories. <br />
Call in (888-874-4888), share your natural brilliance, and discover the joy of a great weekend ahead.<br />
