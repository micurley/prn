Boehner’s Netanyahu Invitation Shows Up Israel Lobby
No Surprise Feds Won’t Indict Ferguson Ex-Cop Who Killed Michael<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Brown
House Speaker John Boehner announced yesterday that he has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress on Iran and the threat of radical Islam on Feb. <br />
11.
<br />
Boehner’s power play and breach of diplomatic protocol (President Obama was not informed) signaled a bare-knuckles partisan fight to the finish of Obama’s term. <br />
But Janet McMahon, managing editor of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, says both Boehner and Netanyahu have confirmed the power and influence of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States.
<br />
 
Leaks from the US Department of Justice are indicating an imminent announcement that federal investigators have found no reason to indict Darren Wilson, the former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown on Aug. <br />
9 last year, setting off nationwide protests against police brutality and excessive use of force.
<br />
Leid Stories revisits its spot-on predictions of no indictments in the case, both at the state and federal levels, and how the outcomes were engineered. <br />
