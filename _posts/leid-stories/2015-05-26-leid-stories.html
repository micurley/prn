Why the Justice Department Deserves A No-Confidence Vote
The U.S.
<!--more-->
Department of Justiceâ€”an agency specializing in recent years in negotiated settlements with criminal enterprises, including several police departmentsâ€”has chalked up yet another â€œvictoryâ€ for â€œpolice reform.<br />
â€
The DOJ is expected to announce today that the City of Cleveland has agreed to remedy a pattern of civil rights violations and use of excessive force long associated with its police department. <br />
The settlement comes after the contentious acquittal Saturday (May 23) of Officer Michael Brelo, who fired 49 of 137 shots at Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams on Nov. <br />
29, 2012. <br />
Russellâ€™s car had backfired as he drove past a police station and as many as 62 police vehicles chased after him for 22 miles, ending in the carnage in which Brelo fired the final 15 shots.
<br />
The DOJ-City of Cleveland dĂŠtente stems from an 18-month probe the department undertook at the request of Mayor Frank G. <br />
Jackson. <br />
Last December, the DOJ issued a â€œscathingâ€ report confirming that â€œCleveland police officers engage in a pattern or practice of unreasonable and in some cases unnecessary force.<br />
â€ But no heads rolled, no one was prosecuted, no one was convicted and sent to prison.
