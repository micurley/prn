The Israel-Gaza Crisis: How We’re Subsidizing the Carnage
Bullies In the Pulpit: For Corporate Media, It’s ‘Nation’<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Time
We may be thousands of miles away from the bombs, bullets and bloodshed, but we’re closer than we think to the carnage in Gaza, says our guest today.
<br />
Janet McMahon, managing editor of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, discusses the uninterrupted flow of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to Israel over the course of several US administrations to build and maintain its military dominance in the Middle East; its use of that power to forcibly displace Palestinians from their ancestral homeland; and powerful allies in Washington who guarantee its economic survival and military capability even as they defend its rogue-state defiance of international conventions on human rights, nuclear arms, democracy and the peace process.
<br />
Corporate media are on the job—jingoistically speaking. <br />
Nationalistic fervor has overtaken the nation’s newsrooms, and all things are told from an us-and-them perspective, harkening back to the good old days of the Cold War.
<br />
Leid Stories cites recent examples of media organizations meting out punishment to errant reporters slow or unwilling to fall in line with propaganda reporting. <br />
