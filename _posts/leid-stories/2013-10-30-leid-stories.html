Detroit: America’s Test Case in Large-Scale Urban Removal
An all-out legal battle in federal bankruptcy court in<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Detroit could set in motion an extreme form of urban warfare – a systematic, forcible emptying of the cityin order to reinvent it to suit social, political and economic interests that envision a “different” America.
<br />
Gov. <br />
Rick Snyder’s appointed emergency city manager, Kevyn Orr, is asking the court to approve a bankruptcy filing to restructure and discharge the city’s $18-billion debt. <br />
But bankruptcy will be a lethal blow to city workers, small businesses, pensioners and an already overburdened, dwindled population of 700,000.
<br />
Mike Nicholson, general counsel for the United Automobile Workers union (UAW), which forced the governor by subpoena to testify, discusses the legal challenge to bankruptcy. <br />
Elena Herrada, an elected school board member and longtime community activist, provides a detailed account of what’s behind the bankruptcy push.
<br />
Now, it’s Detroit. <br />
Soon, it could be Oakland, Chicago and Washington, DC   <br />
