Obama Adds Insults to Injuries at U.N.
<!--more-->
Summit and at Home
With an arrogance that has become his and his administration’s signature trait, President Obama took to the podium at the 68th session of the UN General Assembly and immediately began a lie-riddled narrative on American “exceptionalism.<br />
” Not only is the United States above international law, it damn well deserves to be. <br />
It’s a superpower perk.
<br />
Leid Stories explains that the hush that came over the room as Obama spoke wasn’t awe, but dismay that despite repeated efforts by other countries, the United States has not yet learned how to live as a member-nation in the interdependent world community of nations. <br />
At this session, more lessons from Brazil and Zimbabwe.
<br />
Plus, a solid reason to oppose Obamacare: The lying Clintons think it’s great!<br />
