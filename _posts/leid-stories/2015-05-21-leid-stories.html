First, You Kill the Schools: Behind the Racist Attack on Public School Education
Just about every major city in the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
United States with sizable nonwhite populations is experiencing a crisis with its public-school system.
<br />
This is not accidental, says our guest, Dr Thomas C. <br />
Pedroni, associate professor of curriculum studies and policy sociology at Wayne State University and co-director of the Detroit Data and Democracy Project. <br />
Education policy, he says, is aligned with and reflects a historically racist philosophy and mindset that, despite pronouncements to the contrary, oppose equality and democracy.
<br />
Add to this, Pedroni says, is the “threat” and “inconvenience” these populations pose to the power elite. <br />
Not only are they increasing in number, but they’re living in areas marked for planned “turnarounds.”
Pedroni explains the connection between the fight for public-school education and the parallel struggle for grassroots political power.<br />
