Add Your Flavor to the Intellectual Stew! It’s “Free Your Mind” Friday!
<!--more-->
If you came through this week without an opinion about anything, you are clinically dead.<br />
  
But if like most Leid Stories listeners you’ve been walking around with a week’s worth of heavy-duty opinions just aching to find their way to a mic, then step right up; call in and free your mind.
<br />
It’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories, your chance to pilot the ship where you want it to go. <br />
Offer your best opinions and ideas to a community of thinkers who may differ with you, but never with the intent of gratuitously scoring points. <br />
We function at a much higher level and we have good manners.
<br />
Call in—888-874-4888—and add your flavor to the intellectual stew. <br />
It’s tasty!<br />
