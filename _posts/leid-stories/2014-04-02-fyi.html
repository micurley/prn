Leid Stories Debuts “FYI” – Peer-to-Peer Teaching and Learning
Making Callaloo In Detroit: Author Tells How Culture<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Sustains Her Spirit
Leid Stories proudly presents the first edition of “FYI,” a mini-lecture series designed to encourage further independent research and inquiry into various subjects and issues. <br />
“Essentially, it’s peer-to-peer teaching and learning,” says Utrice Leid, host of Leid Stories.
<br />
“Harvey from Berkeley,” as he identifies himself on call-ins to the show, does an FYI titled: “Fracking: A Vector for Disease.<br />
”
The collapse of the auto industry in Detroit caused Lolita Hernandez, a 33-year worker at General Motors, to fully immerse herself into the craft of writing. <br />
Her newest book, Making Callaloo in Detroit, is a tribute both to her Caribbean lineage and the city where she was born and raised and still lives.
<br />
Against the backdrop of hard times that Detroiters have been experiencing, Hernandez discusses the ways in which her hybrid culture sustains her spirit. <br />
