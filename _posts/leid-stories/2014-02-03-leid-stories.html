The IRP6 &amp; the FBI, Chapter 2: A Raid That Really Wasn’t?
 
On Feb.
<!--more-->
9, 2005, 21 armed FBI agents without warning swarmed the Colorado City offices of Investigative Resource Planning Solutions (IRP Solutions), a fledgling black-owned software-development company that had created an effective, integrated case-management system for law-enforcement and national-security agencies.
<br />
By then IRP’s Case Investigative Life Cycle (CILC) solution had been getting enthusiastic reviews and, from one agency alone, quote requests for more than $100 million in software support. <br />
By then, too, FBI Director Robert Mueller had suffered a humiliating dressing down by a Senate subcommittee for blowing $170 million and more than three years to develop a similar program but had nothing to show for it. <br />
Testimony by Glenn A. <br />
Fine, the Justice Department’s inspector general, sealed the FBI program’s fate; it was scuttled.
<br />
IRP associates Samuel Thurman and Cliff Stewart recall the day of the raid and peculiar things that happened that day that strengthen their belief that sinister motives were behind it. <br />
It was, after all, the reason six of the company’s core executives inexplicably were charged with fraud, and why IRP’s promisingly lucrative future came to an ignominious end. <br />
 
Thurman and Stewart are advocates with A Just Cause, which is seeking a Justice Department investigation into the targeting of the IRP6.
