Get on Your Soapbox, I’ll Give You the Mic!
<!--more-->
Of the millions of things that have happened in the past week, you no doubt have strong feelings and opinions about at least 100 of them. <br />
Pick the one that grinds your gears the most, then firmly plant yourself on your soapbox and persuade us all of your unmatched ability to unmask both offender and offense.
<br />
Be warned: We’ve upped the ante on the fine art of analysis and debate. <br />
Bring your best.<br />
