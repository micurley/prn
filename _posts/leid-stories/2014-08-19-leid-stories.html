‘Attorney at War’ Alton Maddox Warns of Problems in Garner, Brown Cases
Apocalypse Soon?
<!--more-->
 The Middle East’s Present As Apocalyptic Prologue
Attorney Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
, who has litigated or played a major role in several high-profile cases involving excessive force by police, discusses major legal issues in two current cases – the July 17 chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, NY, and the shooting death on Aug. <br />
9 of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
<br />
The “people’s attorney general,” as he is called, says these legal issues can compromise the integrity of both cases, and, thus, their outcomes. <br />
Moreover, they can affect the prosecution of other current and future cases of police killings of civilians, Maddox says.
<br />
Could the Islamist insurgency in the entire Middle East and North Africa, and repeated military interventions by Europe and the West, be setting the stage for an apocalypse of global proportions?
<br />
It’s quite possible, says our guest, Dr Nafeez Ahmed, renowned investigative journalist and international security scholar, who posits the theory in a chilling sci-fi thriller, Zero Point, released this week. <br />
