Speak Your Pro, Debunk the Con, Teach Us All A Lesson!
It’s Open Forum on Leid Stories.
<!--more-->
You take the conversation where you want it to go about an issue in the news – providing you follow at least one rule.<br />
Since the point of all this is developing the fine art of debating, you’ll be expected to posit at least one salient point contrary to your own argument and then skillfully debunk it with a solid argument. <br />
This way, you sound nice, reasonable and level-headed – a real pro, not a con!<br />
Up to the challenge? <br />
Call in and teach us all a lesson!
<br />
