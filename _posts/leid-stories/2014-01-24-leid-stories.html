Apocalypse Now: Detroit’s Engineered Collapse As the New Urban Paradigm
It’s a story unfolding before our eyes, but<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
we’re encouraged not to see it for what it really is. <br />
Detroit’s gone bankrupt, the media and the political establishment tell us, because its mainstay auto industry tanked, its population and tax rolls dwindled, its political leadership was inept and corrupt, and the city can’t meet its operational costs and pension payouts to city workers.
<br />
But Leid Stories’ guests over the past few months have made credible arguments that Detroit’s bankruptcy was not inevitable; it was engineered. <br />
And long before the city got the green light from the governor to declare bankruptcy, there was a grand plan re-imagining its rebirth – with a “different” population.
<br />
Leid Stories contends that Detroit’s engineered collapse is the new urban paradigm – one that suits corporate interests, the political establishment, and the aims and objectives of race and class warfare.<br />
