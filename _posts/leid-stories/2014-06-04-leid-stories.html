Historian Gerald Horne Debunks the Myth of America’s Beginnings;
Preservation of Slavery, He Says, Fueled Founding<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Fathers’ Revolutionary War
As is common lore, the nation was born out of a rebellion against onerous taxes imposed by Britain on its 13 early colonies in America. <br />
Having no representation in Parliament, the colonists deemed tribute to the crown unfair, illegal and an old-world threat to the ideals and freedoms they had come to enjoy in their new world. <br />
Their righteous indignation grew over time and fed the ubiquitous cry to break free of the British Empire—a yearning  achieved with the Revolutionary War (also called the American War of Independence). <br />
The visionary Founding Fathers then forged a new nation, enshrining the colonists’ shared noble values in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, guaranteeing freedom, justice and equality to all.
<br />
It’s a nation-creation myth, says Dr Gerald Horne, John J. <br />
and Rebecca Moores chair of history and African American studies and professor of diplomatic history at the University of Houston. <br />
His newly released book, The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America, is the focus of today’s program.
<br />
The Revolutionary War really was a counterrevolutionary movement, says Horne. <br />
The chief protagonists were “founding fathers” who were heavily invested in slavery in North America and feared the inevitability of abolition by Britain and strategic military help Britain and enslaved Africans in America would receive from leaders of successful slave rebellions in the Caribbean.
