Lynch Mob: PBA Head’s ‘Protest’ Tactics Hold NYC Hostage; Mayor Dithers
The Dec.
<!--more-->
20 ambush killings of two police officers in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn have been feeding the police union’s gristmill of grievances with City Hall. <br />
Stalled contract negotiations and pay hikes top the list of a long list of complaints, says Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch, and the deaths of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, who was buried yesterday, are the battering ram Lynch is using to force concessions from Mayor William de Blasio.
<br />
Lynch, up for re-election as PBA head, has unleashed a particularly venomous campaign, and it’s not just against de Blasio. <br />
Increasingly, police officers are engaging in “protest” tactics that go way beyond insubordination. <br />
Lynch in fact is holding New Yorkers hostage with a veritable work stoppage while the mayor appears either unwilling or unable to bring the Lynch mob in line, says Leid Stories.
<br />
Ironically, the strong-arm conduct of the PBA and its membership is proving the validity of many long-held beliefs and criticisms of the New York Police Department.<br />
