Nigeria’s Muhammadu Buhari: Really A ‘Fresh Start?
<!--more-->
Badges, Bullets &amp; Bodies: Police Killings at All-Time High
Former military strongman Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s president-elect, rode the crest of popular support for his campaign promise to rout both Boko Haram terrorists and rampant government corruption from the continent’s most populous nation. <br />
But as he forms his transition team and selects key members of his administration, which officially begins May 29, Buhari is already warning his countrymen not to expect “miracles.<br />
”
Buhari’s political triumph is being hailed as a “new start,” not only for Nigeria, but also for the region and the continent as a whole. <br />
Is there reason to believe that the former major-general who led a coup in 1983 that brought him to power and whose regime racked up more than a fair share of human rights abuses is now a born-again democrat?
<br />
Dr Chika Onyeani, the Nigerian publisher and editor in chief of the New York-based African Sun-Times, gives his analysis of Buhari’s return to power and its potential impact on the war-ravaged region.
<br />
In March alone, 111 people—most of them unarmed and men of color—were killed by police, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. <br />
Two weeks ago, the US Department of Justice said that Philadelphia police had shot and killed 400 people in seven years, 80 percent of them African Americans. <br />
These and other statistics confirm an extremely disturbing pattern.
<br />
Michael Greys, cofounder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care and cohost of “Community Cop” on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, says the race-based patterns of police killings long have been established. <br />
The issue, he says, is that they continue despite claims of systemic “reforms.”<br />
