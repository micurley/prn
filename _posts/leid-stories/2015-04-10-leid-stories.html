Free Your Mind! It’s for Your—and Our—Own Good!
What a week we’ve had!
<!--more-->
But we’ve survived it—hopefully unscathed, or with only a few minor scrapes and scratches.
<br />
Now, take an analytical look at what we’ve come through and help us make sense of it. <br />
Give us your take on the insanities and absurdities we experienced this week. <br />
Or, take us someplace else entirely, introducing issues and ideas worthy of serious consideration and continuing debate.
<br />
This is the purpose of “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories. <br />
It’s how we help each other keep a grip on reality while not going stark-raving mad.
<br />
Make your contribution to our collective mental health. <br />
Call in (888-874-4888; it’s free!<br />
) and share your unique insights with a hardy, well-mannered lot who appreciate sincerity of effort and independence of thought.
<br />
That done, you can then take comfort in knowing you’ve done your bit save the world.<br />
