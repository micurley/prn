Detroit: Hundreds File Legal Objections to Bankruptcy Exit Plan
Attorney Stanley L.
<!--more-->
Cohen: ‘Always Against the State’
Detroit’s state-appointed emergency city manager, Kevyn Orr, filed an amended bankruptcy-exit plan with the federal court on Monday, as ordered by Judge Steven Rhodes. <br />
Yesterday, federal court again was the venue—this time for massive opposition to the plan. <br />
Inside the courtroom, hundreds of legal objections to the city’s plan formally were filed, while outside on the street hundreds more protested steep cuts to pensions and city services and the sale of city assets Orr’s plan calls for.
<br />
Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of Pan-African News Wire and Detroit organizer for the Workers World Party, reports.
<br />
It was a victory for prosecutors March 26 when, after a three-week trial, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, on three counts of terrorism. <br />
For Ghaith’s attorney, Stanley L. <br />
Cohen, it was a not-surprising outcome.
<br />
Cohen’s legal career, spanning more than 30 years, has been fraught with controversy but based, he says, on a simple maxim: “I defend the individual against the state.” His practice is global; his clients, an assortment of major players in high-stakes social, political and environmental and justice struggles; and his reputation—well, let’s just say his website has a page for “haters.”
In a wide-ranging interview, Cohen discusses his life, the law, the “war on terror,” and the universality of struggle.<br />
