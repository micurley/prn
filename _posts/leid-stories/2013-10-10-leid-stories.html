Kakistocracy: It’s What’s for Government
Starting now and for the immediate future, pay no attention to blather about<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
“democratic rule.<br />
” The triangulation of good ol’ American exceptionalism in Washington — the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government — has killed it. <br />

<br />
Democracy is out. <br />
Kakistocracy — government by the most unprincipled people, the worst elements in our society — is in.
<br />
The current situation is a case study in the dramatic shift that has occurred at practically all levels of government, creating a relationship between those who govern and those governed that more closely resembles that between predator and prey. <br />
It’s not government by the people, for the people; it’s government despite the people, intentionally insulated against their will.
<br />
Leid Stories explains how we got to this point and what can be done about it. <br />
