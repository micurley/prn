It’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories—your turn at bat.
From the wide array of things that vexed you this week<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
select the one that’s the most, well, vexing. <br />
With laser-beam precision take us to the root of your vexation. <br />
Then, bring on the clarity in heavy doses and lead us all into the light.
<br />
Worry not about whether people agree or disagree with your position (for the record, we are no respecters of rote, party-line thinking). <br />
Concentrate instead on making a home run.<br />
