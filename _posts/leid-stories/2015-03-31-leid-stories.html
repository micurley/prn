Talking Things Out: It’s “Free Your Mind” Tuesday!
<!--more-->
Well, we’re making up for “Free Your Mind Fridays” that didn’t happen while PRN’s technological innards were being unscrambled, reassembled and installed. <br />
So, welcome to “Free Your Mind Tuesday!<br />
”
Different day of the week, yes, but the same vibe. <br />
Bring your best ideas and opinions to the best open forum on the planet. <br />
You’re in the driver’s seat, taking the conversation where you want it to go. <br />
Give us you take on the issues of the day or something else entirely that is worthy of further discussion and debate.
<br />
We eagerly await your intellectual offering. <br />
Call 888-874-4888 and free your mind—and ours, too!<br />
