It’s Here! It’s A Day Early! It’s ‘Free Your Mind … Thursday(?
<!--more-->
’
Don’t panic, “Free Your Mind Friday” is still in full effect. <br />
We’re just making a switch to accommodate tomorrow’s guest’s crammed academic schedule (you won’t want to miss that program). <br />
The benefit, of course, is that you get to sound off a whole day sooner!
<br />
The world’s greatest forum for the exchange of opinions and ideas is open to you. <br />
Share your thoughts and unique perspectives on critical issues of the day, or take us on an unscripted tour of other realities we’re reluctant, or too timid, to confront.
<br />
Bring your intellectual best to the gathering place. <br />
Call 888-874-4888 and trade some quality merchandise.<br />
