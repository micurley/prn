Boko Haram: Repeat the Offenses of the Arab Slave Trade
NBC’s ‘Liberals’ Think A Skit About Slave Breeding Is Funny
The<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Non-Racist Mrs Sterling Would Like Her Millions Now, Please
Leid Stories tackles three subjects that require us to suspend belief, common sense and even our dignity:
·   President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria says his military forces tracking as many as 270 girls kidnapped from school on April 14 by the al-Qaeda-linked extremist Islamist group Boko Haram have no idea where they are.<br />
 
·   NBC shamelessly offered for America’s entertainment on its May 3 “Saturday Night” edition a skit featuring an African American woman yearning for the good old days of slave breeding. <br />
At least she’d get a date, she says.
<br />
 ·   Rochelle Sterling, wife of Donald and for more than 30 years co-owner with him of the Los Angeles Clippers, having pronounced herself absolutely free of racist attitudes and racially motivated actions (despite evidence to the contrary), apparently is acceptable as a business partner of the NBA as it proceeds to “punish” her errant husband by selling the team, valued at $575 million. <br />
