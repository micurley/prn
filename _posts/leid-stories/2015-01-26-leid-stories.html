America’s Race-Based Power Conundrum: Any Way Out?
 
A week after Martin Luther King Jr.
<!--more-->
Day, America is fully back to natural mode, the strains of King’s historic exhortations on freedom, justice and equality muffled by the roar of business as usual. <br />
America has paid its symbolic respects to King and his dream, things are much better now, there’s a movie, move on.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses America’s race-based power conundrum—“civil-rights” struggles against “natural-rights” rule and control. <br />
Is there any way out? <br />
