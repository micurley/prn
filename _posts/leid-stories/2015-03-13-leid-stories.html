Has U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Delivered Justice in Ferguson?
<!--more-->
Two police officers shot in Ferguson, Missouri, Wednesday as they guarded the Police Department building during an hours-long community protest have been released from hospital and recovering from their wounds. <br />
Recovery of the embattled town from old and new tensions that bedevil it is not as hopeful.
<br />
The shootings occurred the same day Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned, the latest in a slew of public employees and officials to quit after a US Department of Justice report found and entrenched pattern of racism in the policies and practices of the city’s governing and public-service agencies.
<br />
The DOJ report came with an anti-climactic announcement that no federal charges will be brought against ex-police officer Darren Wilson for shooting to death Michael Brown in on Aug. <br />
9, 2014—the incident that sparked sustained unrest in Ferguson and sympathetic protests across the country demanding justice in the case.
<br />
In an exclusive series last November, “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr. <br />
predicted the Department of Justice decision, as well as the Nov. <br />
24 decision by a county grand jury not to indict Wilson. <br />
Maddox also predicted that a linked case in Staten Island, NY—the chokehold death of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014—similarly would yield no state indictment of Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo; a grand jury announced Dec. <br />
3 that it found no reason to indict him. <br />
Holder promised an “expeditious” federal inquiry into the Garner case the following day. <br />
Results pending.
<br />
The hunt is on for the shooter(s) of the police officers, the heinous act widely condemned. <br />
On Leid Stories, “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr. <br />
pursues answers to the question: Has US Attorney General Eric Holder delivered justice in Ferguson?<br />
