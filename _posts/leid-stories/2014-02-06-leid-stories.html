 Racial Disparities in Health Care (Part 2)
 Concluding her two-part presentation on racial disparities in health and health care, law professor emerita Vernellia Randall (University of Dayton), author of Dying While Black, makes the case that a major impediment in the battle for health and health-care equality in the United States is in the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which, ironically, was enacted to eliminate racial discrimination in all forms.
<br />
Professor Randall explains the problems with the Civil Rights Act and makes recommendations on a law that would close the disparity gap. <br />
Additionally, she tackles the contributing problem of “colorblind racism,” focusing particularly on President Obama’s brand of it.
<br />
Professor Randall writes extensively on and speaks internationally about race, women’s issues and health care. <br />
She is the recipient of the Ohio Commission on Minority Health Chairman’s Award.<br />
 A public-health professional as well, she administered a statewide health program in Alaska. <br />
For the past 15 years, she has focused on eliminating disparities in health care for minorities and the poor.<br />
