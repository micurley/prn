Grand Jury’s Decision A Harbinger for Federal Probe, NYC Chokehold Case?
<!--more-->
For the second day, Ferguson, Missouri, is rocked by protest over a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. <br />
9.
<br />
Gov. <br />
Jay Nixon has ordered an additional 1,500 National Guard troops to the 700 already in Ferguson, which he has placed under martial law. <br />
But the protests continue—and way beyond the geographic boundaries of the small city. <br />
Solidarity protests reportedly are now active in about 100 cities and towns across the nation.
<br />
Today on Leid Stories we follow up on yesterday’s discussion, looking in particular at other legal issues that are still pending in Ferguson, and whether the outcome of the grand jury’s probe is a harbinger for another police-involved killing case in Staten Island, New York—the chokehold death of Eric Garner on July 17—in which key players in the Ferguson case also are involved.
<br />
Once again, we are fortunate to have as our expert guide “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr. <br />
