Hindsight: Lessons Learned, and Not Learned, in 2014 (Part 2)
We continue the discussion we began yesterday: With<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
the
advantage of 20/20 hindsight, what did we learn, or not learn, from 2014?
<br />
Leid Stories listeners undertake a comprehensive review of
the year from their own vantage points, discussing what for them were the defining
issues, events and people of the year. <br />

Yesterday’s callers identified the following as significant
issues in 2014: Police brutality/use of excessive force; US support of the neo-Nazi
regime in Ukraine; the global power shift and its potential for shifting the
power equation in the United States; the global police state; co-optation of the
media; and the individual vs. <br />
the state.
<br />
