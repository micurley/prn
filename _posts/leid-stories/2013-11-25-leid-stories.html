Wall Street bankers, inept city government and a woeful economy are responsible for Detroit’s fiscal woes, says a scathing independent report on the city’s dire fiscal crisis. <br />
The author of the report, Wallace Turbeville, a senior fellow at Demos, a Manhattan-based public-policy think tank, bares the details.
