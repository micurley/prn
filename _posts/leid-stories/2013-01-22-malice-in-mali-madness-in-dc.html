The escalating war in Mali is a deadly drama with many actors in many roles.
<!--more-->
France currently is a lead actor in “retaking” Mali, its former colony, from a collapsed government, a military coup, an internal separatist movement, and an incursion of reputed al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamist rebels from neighboring states. <br />
But France’s intentions are far from honorable, says journalist Gilbert Mercier. <br />
The war in Mali, he says, has set the stage for the recolonization of most of Africa. <br />
Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, President Barack Obama begins his second term selling America the illusion that “we’re all in this together.”
