President Obama apparently deemed it irrelevant that Morehouse College has been battling educational apartheid, shaping<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
the minds of African American men and molding them into stalwart and exemplary leaders since 1867. <br />
Or, maybe he had nothing really relevant or new to say.
<br />
Morehouse’s graduating Class of 2013 sat through a steady rain, complete with thunder and lightning, to hear Obama go homie on them with his standard themes when addressing African Americans, especially men: make good choices and don’t go to jail; don’t be a sperm-donor absentee father; there’s no excuse for a lack of ambition; face up to personal responsibilities; hard work is how one achieves in life.
<br />
For that Morehouse conferred on Obama an honorary doctor of laws degree.
<br />
Did the president go homie at the $32,400-per-couple fundraiser held at the office of the foundation of Arthur M. <br />
Blank, co-founder of Home Depot and owner of the Atlanta Falcons, following his Morehouse gig? <br />
Nuh-uh!
<br />
