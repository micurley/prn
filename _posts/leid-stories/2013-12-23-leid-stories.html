“Where Are We? Where Are We Going?
<!--more-->
 A Year-End Reality Check
At the end of a tumultuous year and on the cusp of another, Leid Stories begins a series of end-of-year discussions to encourage a dialogue about the realities and challenges of life in various segments of our society – both as a reminder that we’re not “all in this together,” and as a caution against the one-size-fits-all, zero-sum model for social, political and economic change.
<br />
 
The series kicks off with attorney Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr., whose deep political activism and four-plus decades as a self-appointed “people’s attorney general” litigating, pro bono, some of the most contentious cases involving official and prosecutorial misconduct in New York history, inform a scathing analysis of the principal impediments to power and progress in the African American community and society at large.<br />
