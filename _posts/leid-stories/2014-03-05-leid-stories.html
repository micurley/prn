Why the Ukraine-Crimea Crisis Should Make Us Change Our Politics
If nothing else, the Ukraine-Crimea crisis should<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

cause us to re-examine our basic political philosophy and orientation. <br />
Why? <br />
Because it clearly hasn’t happened at the leadership level; across the board, they’ve run out of good, innovative ideas and new ways of doing things.
<br />
Leid Stories raises a number of examples that illustrate the stagnation of progress in many spheres of American life, owing largely to an unwillingness, incapacity or downright refusal to embrace new ideas and realities. <br />
No “modern” nation, let alone a “world-leading” one, would tolerate a 2-million-plus prison population, or ninth-place standing in the world on Internet speed, or one-in-seven poverty rates, or would engage in Cold War bloviating and call it diplomacy. <br />
In its policy making the United States is its own conundrum, having a futuristic vision of itself that cannot be accomplished with vapid ideas and ways of doing things.
<br />
Leid Stories expands on this theme and asks the question: The system is impervious to change. <br />
What, then, are our political choices?<br />
