America may be changing demographically, but the nation’s newsrooms are not.
<!--more-->
Studies show that most newsrooms are holding to “diversity” plateaus reached many years ago. <br />
Even so, the news continues to reflect a decidedly white perspective in practically every aspect of editorial content.
<br />
The Kerner Commission, appointed in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson to study the root causes of urban rebellions that had broken out across the nation (all of them in communities of color), pointed to political, social, economic and historical factors that contributed to the violence. <br />
But the commission also blamed the media for exacerbating and maintaining a deeply entrenched racial divide.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses the role of today’s media in a vastly changed America and world.<br />
