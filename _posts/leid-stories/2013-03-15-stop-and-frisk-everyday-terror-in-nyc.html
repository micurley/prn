A class-action lawsuit alleging widespread, routine civil-rights violations of men of color by New York City police<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

comes to trial in federal court next week. <br />
The NYPD will have to explain why, in one year alone, police made 685,724 stops of Black and Latino males under its stop-and-frisk “anti-crime” tactics when more than 90 percent of them were baseless. <br />
Leid Stories examines the psychological impact of the stop-and-frisk program on innocent victims – the focus of an in-depth report that will be introduced at trial.
