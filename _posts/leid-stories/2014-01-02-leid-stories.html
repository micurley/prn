Hospital Causes Brain Death; Says Victim Now A ‘Corpse’
Blunt Hypocrisy: Pot’s Legal Only When the Gov’t Can Tax It?
<!--more-->
 
Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl suffering with sleep apnea, has what her family thinks is corrective surgery. <br />
Instead, she winds up brain dead from cardiac arrest and on life support after the operation. <br />
The hospital wants to pull the plug, saying the child is now a “corpse,” and the family must remove “the body” by Jan. <br />
7.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses the legal, ethical and medical-care issues raised in this controversial case.
<br />
For many Coloradans, New Year’s Day was smokin’! <br />
It was the first day of legal recreational marijuana use in the state (on May 20, 2013, Colorado became the first state legalizing non-medical marijuana use by adults). <br />
It was a high for the state, too – considering it licenses the 136 retail outlets that are serving up a plethora of pot.
<br />
Leid Stories asks: Isn’t it hypocritical of the government to outlaw marijuana and send people to jail for selling it? <br />
Or, is marijuana OK and legal because the government now regulates and taxes it?<br />
