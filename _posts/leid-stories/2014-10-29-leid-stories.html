The Battle for Benton Harbor, Michigan, Unfolds in Weird Court Case
Spooky!

Sharpton Plays A Trick on Ferguson As A Treat for Democrats
Whirlpool Corporation has its eyes on Benton Harbor, Mich.<br />
, an almost all-Black town of just over 10,000 on the shores of Lake Michigan that looks nothing like the toney estates and swank shops the company wants instead. <br />
Whirlpool’s plan to gobble up the town was going well—until the Rev. <br />
Edward Pinkney rallied the locals not only against the corporation, but also against co-opted elected officials, including the mayor, willing to execute its plan.
<br />
In the aftermath of a Pinkney-led recall of the mayor, the fiery pastor found himself charged with five counts of election fraud—allegedly for changing dates on five petitions. <br />
A report from the courthouse yesterday said none of the prosecution’s witnesses could say Pinkney altered any petitions. <br />
Leid Stories gets an update today from Pinkney, who says his trial is “punishment” for organizing against Whirlpool and political corruption.
<br />
Bloviator in Chief Al Sharpton swoops into Ferguson, MO, on a four-day mission, starting on Halloween (Oct. <br />
31), to mine votes for the Democrats in the name of Michael Brown, killed by local police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. <br />
9. <br />
It’s also a pacification program to keep the lid on growing outrage over the handling of the case and speculation that a grand jury will find no reason to indict Wilson.
<br />
Leid Stories discusses Sharpton’s trick-and-treat mission. <br />
