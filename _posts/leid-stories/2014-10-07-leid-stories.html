Detroit: As Trial Winds Down, Claims of Light At End of Bankruptcy Tunnel
The Trouble With Lentils: Life on the Edge In<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Obama’s Prosperous America
The federal trial to determine whether Detroit’s bankruptcy-exit plan is fair and feasible is winding down, but the week began with lawyers for Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, the lone remaining major creditor (with a claim against the city for $1.<br />
1 billion), all wound up over a meager payout. <br />
They want cash and real estate to settle.

Rick Snyder and Mayor Mike Duggan have given emergency manager Kevyn Orr’s draconian plan their blessing—with Snyder predicting that Detroit will be out of bankruptcy within 30 to 60 days.

Abayomi Azikiwe, our correspondent on Detroit’s bankruptcy, provides an update on what’s happening in and out of court.
