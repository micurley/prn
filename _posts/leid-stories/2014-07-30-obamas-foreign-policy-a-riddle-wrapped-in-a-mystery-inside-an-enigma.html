It’s an apt description of US foreign policy objectives and actions under President Barack Obama.

At his lowest point of popularity since taking office in 2009, Obama’s job-approval rating has been hovering between 39 and 41 percent in national polls—disaffection with his handling of the economy a major factor. <br />
