---
Here you are at the end of the week, still standing and holding on. Good for you!
<!--more-->
Now, make your triumph complete by freeing your mind.
<br />
You’ve endured a veritable blitz of information all week from various media sources that tell you what to think about major issues and events. <br />
But it’s a one-way street; you don’t get to say what you think. <br />
Well, that’s what “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories is all about. <br />
You get to have your say.
<br />
Call in to the best speak-your-mind, tell-it-like-it-is show in radio and add your thoughts to the intellectual mix.
<br />
