ACLU Lawsuit Challenges Ferguson Grand Jury Decision
“Attorney at War” Alton H.
<!--more-->
Maddox Jr: ‘Hush Money Is Not Justice’
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Missouri has filed a federal lawsuit in behalf of a grand juror who wants to reveal alleged irregularities in the way St. <br />
Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch conducted a hearing into the shooting death of Michael Brown by former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. <br />
9 last year.
<br />
The two-month-long probe ended with no indictment against Wilson.
<br />
Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of Missouri’s ACLU, discusses “Grand Juror Doe”’s complaint.
<br />
 
In a related development, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has asked Circuit Court Judge Maura McShane to review McCulloch’s handling of the “fatally compromised” grand jury process and appoint a new grand jury to reconsider the case, but under a special prosecutor.
<br />
“Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
, who successfully had forced the appointment of special prosecutors in two highly charged, racially motivated cases in New York, says the ACLU and LDF actions are noble attempts to salvage the Brown case—not only from McCulloch’s manipulations, but also from the less-than-inspired lawyering of the legal team the Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton brought into the case to advise the Brown family. <br />
