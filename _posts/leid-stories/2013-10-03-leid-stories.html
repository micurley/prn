The Shutdown-Obamacare Debacle: A Clarion Call to Action?
<!--more-->
If the current situation in Washington doesn’t confirm for Americans the inherent dangers and limitations of the two-party system, nothing else will. <br />
Every effort is being made to convince us that what we’re witnessing is democracy in action when, in fact, it is a bloodfest among predators over who gets the choicest part of the kill – us. <br />
They’ve had us marked for a long time; they know our habits well. <br />
And so far, they’re right. <br />
There’s a lot of grumbling, but little or no action.
<br />
Leid Stories says now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of new parties. <br />
The Republican and Democratic parties, ideologically fraternal twins (not exactly like each other but close enough), should be thanked for the favor of energizing grassroots political action and an earnest effort at coalition building. <br />
They deserve to be put out of our misery. <br />
