been given official proof of systemic problems within the New York Police Department and the wide berth given to rogue cops.

Eure, the recently appointed inspector general of the New York Police Department, found several cases in which the chokehold, officially banned by the department, was used as officers’ first response to verbal resistance to arrest. <br />
Officers who used the chokehold—implicated in the death of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014—seldom were disciplined.
<br />
Two days earlier, Comptroller Scott Stringer announced that the city will pay $17 million to settle a wrongful-conviction claim brought by three men, half brothers, who spent a cumulative 60 years in prison (one of them died in prison) based on flawed evidence at trial from a detective whose investigations of at least 70 other cases that yielded convictions currently are being reviewed.<br />
