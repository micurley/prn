Appeal Lawyers Cite Major Violations by Judge, Prosecutor; 200 Pages of Trial Transcript Mysteriously<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Disappear
Convicted and sent to prison on federal conspiracy and fraud charges in a trial rife with highly irregular actions by the prosecutor and judge, the six executives of Investigative Resource Planning Solutions Inc. <br />
(the IRP 6) pinned their hopes of vindication on appeals. <br />
But that process, too, has been plagued with aberrations, not the least of which is the mysterious disappearance of at least 200 pages of the transcript of the trial considered very damaging to the judge and prosecutor.
<br />
Gwendolyn Solomon, co-counsel with Mark Geragos in handling the appeals, explains the many ways the IRP6 were denied a fair trial and railroaded into sentences of up to 11 years.
<br />
Sam Thurman and Cliff Stewart—who both worked at IRP and, through an advocacy group, A Just Cause, have been advocating for their colleagues’ release and a Justice Department investigation into the case—discuss the toll it has taken on their families and the business.
<br />
Listeners are invited to ask questions, as this edition rounds out a comprehensive overview of the case, pending further developments.
