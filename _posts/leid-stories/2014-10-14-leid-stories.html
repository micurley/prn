The New Class Warfare: The Oligarchs, the Clerisy and the Yeomanry
Scared Yet?
<!--more-->
 Why Obama’s War and Ebola Policy Should Cause Worry
Out the window with right-versus-left, Republican-versus-Democrat notions of class warfare in America. <br />
Enter Joel Kotkin, author of The New Class Conflict, who not only gives brand-new meaning to a political lexicon many would think has no relevance today, but blasts away at the common notion of a fixed class structure.
<br />

Kotkin, an internationally recognized authority on global, economic, political and social trends, discusses prospects for progress by the majority under shifting alliances and objectives in the new class conflict.
<br />

Judging by the general tone of the Obama administration, everything is under control. <br />
Sure, a few minor hiccups here and there, but really, there’s no need to panic or go off the deep end. <br />
Not so sure, says Leid Stories—considering that President Obama’s own advisers appear to be at odds with his things-are-under-control assessment. <br />
Leid Stories cites two main reasons to worry—the war with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the first manifestations of ebola in the United States.<br />
