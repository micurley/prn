The Ukraine and Venezuela Crises, and U.S.
<!--more-->
Support for ‘Democracy’
Obama’s Shameless Objectification of Black and Latino Youth
Turmoil in Ukrain and Venezuela has dominated news headlines in recent weeks, apace with an escalation in the violent opposition to the now-ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and to President Nicolás Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela regime.
<br />
Generally, the media report both as popular struggles for freedom and democracy—echoing the open support and approval of the Obama administration. <br />
But what really is unfolding in these two countries?<br />
 Noted historian, political scientist, social critic and author Dr Gerald Horne, who has written more than 30 books and 100 scholarly papers and reviews on struggles against imperialism, colonialism, fascism and racism, goes behind the headlines.
<br />
President Obama yesterday launched at the White House an initiative to address key life challenges for African American and Latino boys and young men. <br />
Called “My Brother’s Keeper,” the initiative will focus on education, criminal justice and employment, he said, and nonprofits, businesses and foundations, which have already donated $150 million, will fund its satellite programs.
<br />
Leid Stories explains in a commentary why the noble goals of the program notwithstanding, Obama’s shameless use of “at-risk” populations to tout his philanthropic endeavor does not cancel out the political reality that his administration has done little to improve their lot.
