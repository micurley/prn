Midterm elections 2014 are providing strong clues about where we are as a nation.
<!--more-->
Depending on where locates oneself on the political spectrum, the clues are either assurances that a carefully calibrated system will remain relatively intact, or a harbinger of chaos and doom. <br />
Middle ground has all but disappeared.
<br />
Those feeling secure, of course, are not worrying about the political choices they will make. <br />
But large numbers of those who are worried are caught in an awful bind; theyâ€™re not at all comfortable with the political choices they will make.
<br />
Considering that the Republican-Democratic duopoly will dominate the political choices of most voters, will it also include Progressives and people of color this time around? <br />
Or, will midterm elections spawn new political activism and movements?
<br />

If the latter, says Leid Stories, the time has come for no-frills, no-thrills democracy and serious coalition building predicated on eradicating all impediments to freedom, equality and justice.<br />
