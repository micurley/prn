Running Dry In Detroit: More Than 100,000 At Risk of Water Shutoffs
Seeking Justice for Eric Garner, But Sharpton Is<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
In A Political Chokehold
Add a water crisis and a fast-developing public-health problem to the long list of miseries heaped upon beleaguered Detroiters as the city seeks to declare bankruptcy.
<br />
Tens of thousands of households unable to pay their water bills have no running water. <br />
And 100,000 more facing shutoffs aren’t sure what will happen after a citywide moratorium ends on Aug. <br />
25.
<br />
Curt Guyette, an investigative reporter for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan focusing on Michigan’s emergency management law, discusses the human-rights and related legal issues raised by the water-shutoff crisis, and says that the shutoffs are being done “in a way that disproportionately affects African Americans, a concern echoed by the United Nations.<br />
”
The Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton’s Aug. <br />
23 “March for Justice for Eric Garner” across the Verrazano Bridge into Staten Island instead will be a caravan—owing to safety concerns, not capitulation to City Hall or the NYPD, he says.
<br />
But even as he takes the lead in channeling the community’s outrage over Garner’s NYPD-inflicted chokehold death, demanding justice in the case, Sharpton is himself in a political chokehold, and it already is affecting the legal course of the case.
<br />
