Man on Fire: Obama Sets Up Rebound From Foreign-Policy Missteps
In his penultimate year in office, President Obama is a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
man on fire, snatching every bit of legacy he can get from a Republican-controlled Congress that has him marked for ignominy.
<br />
Republicans were quick to dispute the great strides on the domestic front the president laid claim to in his Jan. <br />
20 State of the Union address, and were especially critical of his administration’s foreign-policy agenda. <br />
Nothing new here.
<br />
What is new is Obama’s clear intention to rebound from foreign-policy missteps with a hands-on approach to deal making and deal closing that has netted him two impressive deals this year—Cuba and, as of yesterday, India.
<br />
Is Obama truly on the foreign-policy rebound? <br />
Diplomatic scholar, historian, attorney and prolific author Dr Gerald Horne answers the question comprehensively. <br />
Horne is the John J. <br />
and Rebecca Moores chair of history and African American studies at the University of Houston.<br />
