Q’s Life Still Matters: A Family’s Quest for Justice In A Police Killing      (Part 3)
L’Sana DJahspora, the father of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
20-year-old game designer Cinque “Q” DJahspora, learned on the night of Nov. <br />
6, 2014 that his son was dead—shot by a Jackson, Tennessee, police officer near the condominium complex where the DJahsporas lived.
<br />
The way police dealt with him—when when they came to his door to inform him of the incident and that his son was taken to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital—unnerved him, L’Sana said in Part 1 (March 17). <br />
Their curtness turned into open hostility at the hospital, where he went to identify his son, he said. <br />
He was given very little information about what had happened, and the little that he did get just wasn’t adding up. <br />
L’Sana said he began to suspect a coverup was in the making.
<br />
In Part 2 (March 19), L’Sana described his battle to get information and official documentation and reports about how and why his son was killed—“executed,” he alleged, noting that Q was shot in the back (the trajectory of the bullet pointing downward, suggesting he was shot while laying on the ground), and the medical examiner ruled Q’s death a homicide.
<br />
In today’s installment, L’Sana takes us deeper into the legal labyrinth he and his family have been navigating in their quest for answers and justice. <br />
More and more, he says, their suspicions of a coverup proved to be valid. <br />
