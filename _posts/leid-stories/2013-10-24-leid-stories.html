New Party Aims to End “Plantation Politics” in New York
Emulating the spirit of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Party of the civil-rights ’60s, the recently formed Freedom Party in New York City has trumped considerable odds against it and in a short time has accomplished much: It has qualified for ballot status and is fielding two candidates (for mayor and for public advocate) in the Nov. <br />
5 general election.
<br />
It is the beginning of a two-tiered plan with a long-term aim, says today’s guest, “Attorney-at-War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
, the party’s founder and strategist. <br />
Ultimately, he says, it’s about developing effective political alternatives for disfranchised constituencies, mostly of people of color, and putting an end to “plantation” politics.
<br />

Maddox details the party’s “Plan A” and “Plan B” for the general election and beyond.<br />
