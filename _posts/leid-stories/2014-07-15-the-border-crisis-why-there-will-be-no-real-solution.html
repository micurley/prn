title: 'The ‘Border Crisis’: Why There Will Be No Real Solution'
---
Sandbagged by yet another crisis that has put him and his administration on the defensive, President Obama has decided<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
to take the tried-and-true approach to dealing with it: throw obscene amounts of money at the problem.
<br />
He’s hardly likely to get from Republicans the $3.<br />
7 billion he’s requesting from Congress to handle nonstop illegal entry into the United States—now, via the porous border with Mexico, by tens of thousands of unaccompanied children. <br />
But even if he does get the money, the president will be spending it on the effects of the problem, not on eradicating the problem itself.
<br />
Leid Stories explains why there will be no real solution to the “border crisis,” certainly not on Obama’s watch, and why the major players in this political drama have no interest in getting at its root causes. <br />
Listeners contribute their thoughts.
