Speaking Truth to Power: A Conversation with Vernellia Randall
Retirement hasn’t slowed down Vernellia Randall.
<!--more-->
Quite the contrary, it has given her a second wind. <br />
The former University of Dayton School of Law professor has doubled down on her activist work, “speaking truth to power” (her motto on her website), and “work[ing] continuously at changing the world through law, love and activism.<br />
”
Randall, who writes and lectures extensively on race, women’s issues, health care and the law, joins Leid Stories for a wide-ranging conversation about justice in America.
<br />
She is a co-founder of Racial Justice Now, an Ohio grassroots organization of educators, parents, clergy and community activists dedicated to fighting institutional and systemic racism and holding people in power accountable.
<br />
Apart from her academic accomplishments in law, Randall, a registered nurse, has had an impressive career in public health as an administrator of a statewide public-health program in Alaska. <br />
She is the author of Dying While Black, an in-depth look at race-based disparities in US health care.<br />
