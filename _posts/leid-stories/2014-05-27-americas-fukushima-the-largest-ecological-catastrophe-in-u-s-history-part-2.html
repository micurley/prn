Investigative reporter Paul DeRienzo files the second installment of a series on an ecological disaster caused by<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

massive contamination from the Hanford Site, a sprawling nuclear-reactor complex on the Columbia River in south-central Washington state.
<br />
The still-partially-functioning site, built in 1943, was where two-thirds of the nation’s plutonium was manufactured during World War II and the Cold War. <br />
It housed the world’s first plutonium-production reactor that produced much of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the nuclear bombs used against Japan. <br />
But the operation of its nine reactors, phased out between 1968 and 1987, has created the largest ecological disaster in the United States.
<br />
During those 40-plus years, DeRienzo says, a steady stream of industrial and radioactive waste created by the production of the element was dumped directly into the air, river and ground of the 586-square-mile reservation. <br />
“Now, the United States is faced with the largest cleanup in history, and little hope that it will totally succeed,” he says.
<br />
DeRienzo, working under a Polk Awards journalism grant, presents exclusively for Leid Stories Part 2 of his investigation: “The Hanford Site: America’s Fukushima.”<br />
