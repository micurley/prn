The Irony Vote In Washington, D.C.; Sharpton Mines the Dead for Votes
Ferguson On  Edge; Locals Await Grand Jury<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Decision In Brown Case
Early voting begins today in Washington, DC, and turnout is expected to be high as the district votes for a mayor, its first attorney general in the district, seven council seats, a council chair, and a referendum on legalizing marijuana possession.
<br />
There’ll be no congressional candidates listed on the ballot because Washington, DC—the nation’s capital, the seat of democracy—does not have a House or Senate seat.
<br />
Meanwhile, the Rev. <br />
Al Sharpton is employing a new gimmick in his Democratic Party gig to “bring souls to the polls.<br />
” Even for him, it sets a new low—using the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner to convince Blacks that their votes for Democratic candidates will end police brutality.
<br />
Today marks two months to the day that St. <br />
Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCullough began presenting evidence to a grand jury in the Aug. <br />
9 shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson to determine whether Wilson should be charged with any crimes.
<br />
Leaks from the grand jury were suggesting that it was likely not to indict. <br />
Still more leaks said a decision would soon be announced, although McCullough had gotten two extensions for the grand jury’s term, ending in early November. <br />
Either way, Ferguson tensely awaits a decision.
<br />
Leid Stories returns to the legal issues it has raised about the case.<br />
