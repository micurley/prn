House Republicans this week will launch yet another inquiry into the events that led to the terrorist attack on a U.S.
<!--more-->
diplomatic post in Benghazi, Lybia, on Sept. <br />
11 last year that claimed the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. <br />
But behind the quest for truth about the debacle is the clear intent to establish legal grounds for impeachment of the president. <br />

Leid Stories explains the Republicans’ move; why Obama ought to thank Hillary Clinton for the mess he’s in; and why Benghazigate will be to Obama what Watergate was to Nixon.
<br />
Also, Phyllis Bennis of the International Policy Institute discusses the impact of Israel’s airstrikes against Syria on the region and how it will test Obama’s pledge of “unconditional” support for Benjamin Netanhayu’s government.
