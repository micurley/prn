How Do You Like Him Now?
<!--more-->
 The ‘Peace’ President Is A Hostage of His War
Oddly, it was his Nobel Peace Prize lecture on Dec. <br />
10, 2009 that first hinted that the “peace” candidate put into the White House just a year earlier by millions of Americans clinging to the Democrat’s promise of “hope” and “change [they] could believe in” was in fact a war hawk like George W. <br />
Bush, his Republican predecessor.<br />
  
The ensuing years and last week’s “declaration of war” against Islamic State terrorists holed up in pockets of Iraq and Syria—a pretext for the re-invasion of the former and long-planned invasion of the latter—have removed all doubt. <br />
Obama’s bomb-first-talk-later directive and his reckless disregard for the rule of law and democratic principles, both domestically and internationally, make Bush’s state crimes against democracy look like mere slipups.
<br />
Leid Stories dismantles Obama’s warhead, explaining why the president feels compelled to out-hawk the war hawks, and how, ironically, this has made him a hostage of his cranked-up version of Bush’s utterly disastrous “war on terror.”<br />
