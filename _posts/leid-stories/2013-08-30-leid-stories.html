LEID STORIES PROMO — Friday, Aug.
<!--more-->
30, 2013
Hello Casey, here is the promo for Leid Stories today:
Advice and Consent: Decision on Syria Points Up Dramatic Difference Between US and Britain on Democracy
The British Parliament yesterday (Aug. <br />
29) rejected a motion by Prime Minister David Cameron to join an allied military strike against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons in rebel strongholds that have killed hundreds of civilians and injured thousands more in a civil war that has been raging since April 2011.
<br />
What is instructive is the process that produced the vote – a vigorous, free-wheeling open debate, with the prime minister alternatively making his case and being called to account, and with equally vigorous challenges from the opposition and splinter parties.
<br />
President Obama, his administration and Congress, on the other hand, are contemplating possible US involvement – and have already mobilized the military — behind closed doors, shutting out public scrutiny of the process.
<br />
Leid Stories illustrates the difference between government by the people and for the people and government isolated from and insulated against the people.
<br />
