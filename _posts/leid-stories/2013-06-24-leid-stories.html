The Zimmerman Trial: The Prosecutor As Co-Defendant
As opening statements begin today in the trial of George Zimmerman<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
for the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin, “Attorney-at-War” Alton H. <br />
Maddox Jr.<br />
—who set legal precedence in 1986 by forcing the appoint of a special prosecutor in a hate-crime case—itemizes a bill of particulars against Special Prosecutor Angela Corey.
<br />
Several of Corey’s legal actions raise serious questions about her competency and understanding of the law, Maddox says, and several other actions that she failed to take suggest a deliberate effort to avoid political blowback that could end her career. <br />
Either way, says Maddox, Corey is the chief reason that the trial of George Zimmerman is a compromised case from the start.
<br />
To date, Maddox, as a self-appointed legal observer, is the only private citizen who continuously has notified both Corey and the supervising judge of her judicial district of alleged legal infractions committed by the special prosecutor’s office. <br />
These missives and associated issues are the bill of particulars discussed on Leid Stories today.
