President Obama is having a rough time of it.
<!--more-->
A war that isn’t going his way, a still-stagnant economy, signs of incipient ebola contagion, a combative Congress that won’t play ball, the immigration debacle, militarization of police, and a restive electorate that’s turned off by politics and the political process are some of the reasons he’s getting grayer by the day.
<br />
Anti-Obama sentiment is gaining momentum, and for assorted reasons. <br />
Significantly, though, in recent months blistering criticisms of him have been coming from people he trusted—former high-level insiders, including Cabinet-level appointees and administration officials—who now openly endorse the contentions of “the other side” about Obama’s leadership and capacity to govern.
