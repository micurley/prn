Kwame Fosu, policy director of the Rebecca Project for Human Rights, and Dr Randy Short, social justice minister and president of The Clergy Coalition, discuss a coalition’s efforts to stop the mass-marketing of the controversial injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera to women of color in the United States and other parts of the world without informing them of the potentially lethal effects of the drug. <br />
The issue is the focus of a hearing before the Congressional Black Caucus tomorrow.
