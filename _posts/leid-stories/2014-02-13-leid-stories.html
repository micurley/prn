Obama: The I-Don’t-See-You, I-Don’t-Hear-You President
 
Five years into his two-term tenure, and President Obama is as<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
indifferent to the harsh realities of life for his core constituencies as any segregationist Dixiecrat or benign-neglect Northern pseudoliberal ever was. <br />
He’s got “a pen and a phone” this year, he said, as some sort of threat to Republicans that he’ll bypass their legislative roadblocks either by executive order or extra-skillful schmoozing.
<br />
The truth is, Obama cares less about the people who put him in office and more about the big-money corporate interests and a demimonde of ruthless, ambitious political vampires who appear to be high on his list of priorities. <br />
They get his personal attention and even guarantees; his repeatedly abused political base gets scripted platitudes.
<br />
Leid Stories keeps tabs on the I-don’t-see-you, I-don’t-hear-you president, documenting for those unwilling to do so themselves additional reasons to abandon hope of redeeming the recidivist Obama and, ultimately, to abandon the gutless Democratic Party itself.<br />
