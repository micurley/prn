Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Progress Report
Your Own Pressure Valve—“Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories!
<!--more-->
Keith Cook, the brother of political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal, gives a progress report on efforts to safeguard Mumia’s health and demand accountability by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections for his deteriorated condition.
<br />
Last Monday (March 30), Mumia was found passed out from diabetic shock and almost in a comatose state. <br />
It has since been determined that he had been diabetic for quite some time in incarceration, but was neither diagnosed nor treated for the disease. <br />
In recent months, Mumia’s health has deteriorated significantly, leading his family and supporters to contend that it’s a deliberate attempt by the state to hasten his death through negligence.
<br />
Judging from the news headlines, the world is going mad. <br />
But you don’t have to. <br />
You can plug into a growing community of sane people who help each other make sense of what’s happening in the world by simply sharing their insights, opinions and analyses of what’s behind the headlines—and a lot more besides.
<br />
Don’t let them distort your reality. <br />
But do take advantage of the best reality check ever—“Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories. <br />
It’s where the best minds gather for conversations that really matter.
<br />
Call in on 888-874-4888 and add your own unique perspective to the simmering pot. <br />
It’ll do you—and the rest of us—a whole lotta good! <br />
