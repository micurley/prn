Just for you, it’s “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories!
<!--more-->
It’s when listeners flip the script on major news issues and events, or on any subject they choose. <br />
There’s only one requirement for participating in this free-wheeling discussion: You must have an opinion and be able to defend it; neutrality is a total copout.
<br />
Bring your considered opinions and ideas to the best open forum and test your—and our—intellectual mettle. <br />
We are nice people with good manners. <br />
We will receive your offering with great respect.
<br />
Join us. <br />
Free your mind. <br />
It will do us all a world of good!<br />
