American Democracy: A Matter of Dollars and Common Sense
Collectively the personal fortunes of 400 of the wealthiest<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Americans — $2.<br />
02 trillion, an all-time high — exceed Russia’s economy, says Forbes magazine. <br />
Meanwhile, 46.<br />
5 million Americans (15 percent of the nation) live in poverty, and the income gap between rich and poor is the widest it has been in almost 100 years.
<br />
These and other figures and statistics aren’t just telling a story about the lopsidedness of the US economy; they’re saying that the political system that has delivered these realities also is woefully out of kilter. <br />
In other words, rethink that mythical notion of “democracy.<br />
”
Why? <br />
Because democracy, says Leid Stories, is not about voting. <br />
It’s about assuring reasonable access to the strategic resources of society.
<br />
The statistics have been trending this way for years, but have shown dramatic aberrations since the fiscal crisis of 2008, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. <br />
The trends can be stopped – if people change their self-annihilating political habits. <br />
