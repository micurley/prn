In the Dominican Republic, Mass Deportations of Haitians Loom
Rachel Dolezalâ€™s Racial Dilemma Is An Old American<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Story
Hundreds of thousands of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic face deportation if by the end of the day today they arenâ€™t able to comply with complicated, widely criticized laws the government has set for their residency and citizenship in the country.
<br />
Veteran journalist Kim Ives,Â a prizewinning documentarian and editor of the news weekly HaĂŻti LibertĂŠ, explains the history and impact of these race-based laws, which have rendered more than 500,000 Haitians in the Dominican Republic stateless.
<br />
The Rachel Dolezal saga continues to dominate the headlines, with new stories highlighting deep family dysfunction. <br />
But the story that started it allâ€”her self-assigned racial identity as an African American womanâ€”is in fact an old American story, says Leid Stories.Â <br />
