Detroit Bankruptcy Trial: All Sides Are Telling It to the Judge
Department of Justice Still Thinks Police Killings Are<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
A ‘Civil-Rights’ Issue
More than a year after the City of Detroit, under state-imposed emergency management, filed for municipal bankruptcy to discharge $18 billion in debts, a high-stakes federal trial, the final phase of the bankruptcy process, is set to determine whether the city’s plan is fair to all interested parties seeking to protect their financial interests.
<br />
The trial started Tuesday (Sept.<br />
2) with a bang. <br />
Lawyers for the city said its bankruptcy-exit plan is workable and has broad approval. <br />
But yesterday, lawyers for New York-based bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc.<br />
, one of the largest creditors with $400 million owed, told Judge Steven Rhodes they will not accept 10 cents on the dollar, as the city has proposed.
<br />
Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of Pan-African News Wire, who has been Leid Stories’ correspondent on Detroit’s bankruptcy and related matters, gives us a comprehensive overview of what’s at stake in the trial for Detroiters, who the major players are, and what they want from the court.
<br />
US Attorney General Eric Holder announces today that he will launch a comprehensive civil-rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri. <br />
It’s where Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown on Aug. <br />
9 works, and the department that brought to national attention the increasingly militarized police response to civil protest.
<br />
In a commentary, Leid Stories contends that while Holder’s action may satisfy political considerations, it continues the sorry legacy of the Justice Department regarding the killing of African Americans a “civil-rights” matter, and not a mandate for vigorous criminal prosecutions.<br />
