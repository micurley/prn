“Uniting-and-Strengthening-America-By-Fulfilling-Rights-And-Ensuring-Effective-Discipline-Over-Monitoring Act of 2015. <br />
How quaint! <br />
How cool! <br />
And how despicably deceptive! <br />
Virtually nothing has changed. <br />
And almost all the “changes” have been compensated for elsewhere in this execrable bill. <br />
The lie of increasing home prices having anything to do with genuine demand. <br />
A fine analogy connected to harmful money injected into the system. <br />
Alan Greenspan busy at work blaming everyone else for his social crimes. <br />
More on the coming clash between the US and China. <br />
Continued decline in factory orders for the eighth successive month. <br />
Durable goods and capital goods also down. <br />
You cannot beat the system. <br />
Don’t even try. <br />
The American people show active encouragement to presidential hopefuls who advocate ramping up America’s superpower status. <br />
A horrific example of police brutality.
<br />
