title: The Unemployment Lies Unravelled For You
---
It is easier for most people to believe the government and media reports about economic improvement.
<!--more-->
It is only a small minority who want to know the unvarnished truth. <br />
Lots of statistics for you, showing how the lies get created and why they are unbelievable. <br />
Greater and greater official efforts to control you and your access to knowledge are being put in place. <br />
Why the 2008 crash was but a warm-up to the ‘real thing’ which is the undoing of sovereign governments themselves.<br />
  The nonsense about American business being ‘healthier than ever before’ exposed. <br />
The difference between a business-cycle recession and what we have now: the end of a debt supercycle. <br />
We are looking at expanding debt and collapsing growth, a fatal mixture. <br />
A look at the problem of growth and where it comes from. <br />
The plight of homelessness among American children.<br />
