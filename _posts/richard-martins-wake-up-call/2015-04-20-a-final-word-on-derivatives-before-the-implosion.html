title: A Final Word On Derivatives Before The Implosion
---
Warning! This will be a tough one. You need all your wits about you because this is complicated.
<!--more-->
But I’ve done my best to keep it as simple as possible. <br />
I start by explaining what derivatives are and then try to show how their unraveling will be responsible for the coming collapse. <br />
If you don’t understand, write in and explain the problem and I’ll try again on Friday. <br />
It really is important to grasp this. <br />
The media will simply not go there because the story is too confronting. <br />
Oh yes, they’ll yell from the rooftops once the crisis is underway. <br />
But they’ll let you all get creamed first. <br />
The United States Federal Register. <br />
The irrational speculative mania currently underway in Europe. <br />
How America protected the Nazis but is currently throwing its own citizens under the bus. <br />
The perils of Australian government debt: stay away! <br />
The madness of “negative equity”. <br />
Where are all the ideal contenders for the presidency in your country? <br />
Is Hillary Clinton really the best you can do? <br />
Obamacare enrollment appears to have peaked.<br />
