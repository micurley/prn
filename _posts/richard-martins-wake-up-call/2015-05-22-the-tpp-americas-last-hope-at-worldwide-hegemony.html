title: 'The TPP: America’s Last Hope At Worldwide Hegemony'
---
Obama openly admits trying to prevent China’s ascendancy. The U.S.
<!--more-->
is clearly looking for domination and submission in Asia. <br />
If-and-when the Americans are not successful, we are looking at devastating war. <br />
The TPP has nothing to do with the interests of the American people. <br />
A ‘cleared liaison’ and tremendously qualified ex-commissioner, Michael Wessel, gives a damning indictment of the TPP. <br />
How employment is affected by tasks and function that we do ourselves: Internet banking, self-checkout at stores, printing our own boarding passes, etc. <br />
Those jobs are disappearing. <br />
This is a huge drain on employment. <br />
New escalation of tensions between China and the US Bankruptcies are soaring again nationwide. <br />
China has overtaken Mexico as the top importer of immigrants to the United States. <br />
Western countries snub Russia at its celebrations of ‘V Day’ over Nazi Germany despite the fact that Russia accounted for nearly 80% of all allied war casualties.
