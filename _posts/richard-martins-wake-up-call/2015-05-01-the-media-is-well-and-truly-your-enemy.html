title: The Media Is Well-And-Truly Your Enemy
---
Blind optimism, a characteristic particular to Americans, is encouraged brazenly by the main stream media.
<!--more-->
The entire forces of the media conspire to force people to spend money (they don’t have) instead of saving. <br />
Just another example of where the media is your enemy and the friend of business and finance. <br />
They are simply doing the bidding of their bosses. <br />
Americans are not ‘saving’. <br />
They have no money to save. <br />
They are paying down debts! <br />
Where the media cannot persuade, they lie. <br />
Americans need to understand that ‘positive thinking’ is a trap. <br />
It taps into the thinking of the addict, the drug-of-choice being ‘hopium’. <br />
We examine the case of Mc Donald’s. <br />
Americans are far worse off than they know. <br />
I talk about ‘rehypothecation’, a concept that may be unfamiliar to you but that bears examining. <br />
It involves gold! <br />
Tesla’s absurd market valuation exposed.
