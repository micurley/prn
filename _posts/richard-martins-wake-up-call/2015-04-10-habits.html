Much of our lives is constrained by bad habits and the unthinking actions we take that go with them.
<!--more-->
Current research focuses on how to adopt good habits easily (you’ll be surprised) and the absurdity of the reasoning that goes behind so many of our habits. <br />
This is useful in many ways: sticking to a budget, breaking eating habits, flossing, living in America when you could be a lot better off elsewhere… More lies about unemployment statistics. <br />
Disability fraud. <br />
Once people go on disability, they almost never come off… Disgruntled employees. <br />
The AIIB new monetary system led by the Chinese. <br />
Lots of countries are joining. <br />
GDP forecasts (a total waste of time). <br />
Not counting workers 55 or older, working-age Americans have 1.<br />
5 million fewer jobs than 15 years ago.
