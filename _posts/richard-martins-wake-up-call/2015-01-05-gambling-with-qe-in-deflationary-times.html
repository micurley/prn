The 2015 introductory edition… The theme-of-the-year remains “War”.
<!--more-->
The grand unraveling as viewed through the eyes of Japan. <br />
The unthinkable amounts of debt jammed into the system by insane central bankers with no possible idea of what they were trying to achieve. <br />
This was irrational behavior at its most extreme. <br />
The entire edifice must collapse since the debt is totally unpayable. <br />
Japan is the poster-child of mass irresponsibility by government. <br />
It is impossible to analyse the mindset of such incredible, mass stupidity. <br />
The entire world is infected. <br />
The gravity of all this is unparalleled in all of time. <br />
Casinos and their future. <br />
A few words on the TPP which Obama is determined to push through (though no one seems to know why it’s so important to him). <br />
It must be stopped.
