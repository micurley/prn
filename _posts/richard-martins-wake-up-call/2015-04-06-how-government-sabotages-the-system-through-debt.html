debt creation and expenditure. <br />
It is pathetically easy to distort GDP, for example, rendering the figures useless. <br />
The US government deliberately spins confusion and chaos to disguise the enormity of its obscene failures.<br />
  They don’t even define correctly or even coherently what constitutes “national debt”. <br />
Obfuscation is what counts with these people. <br />
The AIIB, China’s new anti-dollar alliance. <br />
More and more countries are signing up to distance themselves from the United States’s version since 1946. <br />
The US government tries to make “debt” seem like “assets”. <br />

Warning: Puerto Rico bankruptcy a virtual certainty. <br />
Don’t leave (triple-tax-free) money there. <br />
A lesson in Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore for Malaysians (and the rest of us).
