title: 'Greece: Victim Of An Experiment Gone Horribly Awry'
---
The word â€˜crisisâ€™ originates from Ancient Greece. Itâ€™s actually a medical term.
<!--more-->
Greece leads an unparalleled crisis throughout the whole of Europe. <br />
The European Union â€“ and the Euro â€“ are the dumbest inventions of this age. <br />
I shudder to think what future generations will say about all this. <br />
We examine how things would have turned out if the Federal Reserve had never been invented. <br />
The â€˜No Plan â€˜Bâ€™â€™ nature of this crisis reminds one of France on the eve of the German invasion in 1940. <br />
The corporate coup dâ€™ĂŠtat. <br />
Millennials are smart as a group but this hasnâ€™t helped them. <br />
They are still financially and economically trapped. <br />
The horrendous state of Californiaâ€™s aquifers and the thousands of miles of land in the Central Valley and elsewhere which are sinking. <br />
The subsidence problem is worsening, playing havoc with the infrastructure.
<br />
