The consumer simply has no money nor access to any. <br />
An interview with a supporter of the TPP and his ridiculous, nonsensical arguments. <br />
The imminent economic demise of Chicago and direct comparisons with Detroit. <br />

Rates are falling hard. <br />
Greece moving ever-closer to default. <br />
The US slammed over its rights record at the United Nations’ Human Rights Council. <br />
Lack of infrastructural improvements. <br />
Stock market comment. <br />
The insolvency of the FDIC. <br />
