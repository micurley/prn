There has been no resolution to any of the issues connected to the 2008 financial crisis. Things have simply got worse.
<!--more-->
I list plentiful statistics in support of this. <br />
There is no solution. <br />
We have long-since passed the point-of-no-return. <br />
A kamikaze set of government-inspired, financial suicide policies have been undertaken by governments worldwide, all of which will lead to financial Armageddon. <br />
I take you on a tour of the US social scene, trying to draw the loose ends together to create a picture of social hell which unavoidably awaits. <br />
It is a very grim picture indeed. <br />
Global debt has not ceased to grow since 2007. <br />
All major economies have higher levels of borrowing relative to GDP than they had in 2007. <br />
Entirely and exclusively created and financed by the central banks. <br />
All the ‘recovery’ talk is a cruel sham.
