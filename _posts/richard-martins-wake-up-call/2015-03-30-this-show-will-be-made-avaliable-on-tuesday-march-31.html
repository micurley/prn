The Administration wants the TPP to be seen as its legacy so they are giving maximum push to gain Fast-Track authority<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

in Congress. <br />
This is a renewed effort. <br />
Here at the Wake-Up Call we fired up a response months ago – which apparently worked! <br />
– but we need to get ready to do so again. <br />
There is more support for this than there was before. <br />
Not much but enough to be of concern. <br />
I discuss only a partial account of why this is an execrable bill. <br />
There’s lots more (that I’ve discussed before). <br />
Listen to Mike Maloney talking about ‘net neutrality’, which basically turns the Internet into a utility, thus regulated by the dreaded FCC. <br />
 A simplified explanation of how Greece got into its mess. <br />
How Janet Yellen manipulates Wall Street. <br />
A new account describing the immense fragility of the economic situation and how the system has falsified reality in favor of the ‘in-crowd’. <br />
It’s all about to come crashing down. <br />
I explain why.
