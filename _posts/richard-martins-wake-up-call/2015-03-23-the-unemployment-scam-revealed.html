An appreciation of his work in developing Singapore to become the powerhouse it is today. <br />
An attempt to unravel the lies and prevarications put about by the Bureau of Labor(ed) Statistics. <br />

A breakdown of the figures shows this cannot possibly be correct. <br />
In addition, those with just one hour of employment per week are counted as ‘employed’. <br />
