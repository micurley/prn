Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus discusses the current state of the Transpacific Partnership free trade deal and why negotiations between the 12 countries are temporarily ‘on hold’ until after the US midterm elections this November. <br />
Last week’s  show theme of the ‘Emerging Global Economic Perfect Storm’ is followed up with a brief view of what’s happening to Japan’s now faltering economic recovery, called ‘Abenomics’ after Japan’s present prime minister, Abe, and why even more money injection (QE) by Japan’s central bank is coming as Japan’s economy continues to slow. <br />
(see Dr Rasmus’s just published article, ‘The Emerging Global Perfect Storm’, on the PRN website on why the global economy is entering a ‘3rd phase’ of crisis).<br />
  Dr Rasmus concludes the show with some initial commentary on the recent Ukrainian ‘revolution/coup d’etat’. <br />
The fundamental dynamic in the Ukraine is about ‘crony capitalists’ on both sides behind the scenes fighting for control as the Ukrainian economy sinks, while emerging fascist parties in control of the streets rise to contend for power in the Ukraine.  The US-EU move behind the scenes to establish ‘its capitalists’ in parliament, and drive out the former Soviet ex-bureaucrats turned ‘crony capitalists’, is what the revolution is about, Rasmus notes.  The US-EU would like to stabilize the situation in the next parliament elections this spring, but it remains to be seen whether the proto-fascists in the streets can be excluded.<br />
  If the latter gain a foothold, expect parts of the Ukraine to secede, beginning with the Crimea. <br />
Meanwhile the Ukrainian economy, already among the worst in the world, will decline further, and EU and US promises of $tens of billions in bailout will not be delivered, Rasmus predicts.
