 ‘Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus welcomes guests, Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers, to discuss whether the US Empire today is growing weaker or stronger (or both). <br />
Jack provides background on the dimensions of US Empire today—economically, politically, and military—explaining how the US rules globally differently today than classical empires of the past. <br />
The US Empire’s network of multinational corporations, global economic institutions (IMF, World Bank, $ as world currency, G7, central bankers, shadow banks, etc.), political institutions (UN Security council, , and military alliances (NATO, US-Japan, US-Israel, etc.<br />
) and the US’s 1000+ military bases and outposts around the world are described, as well as more recent US development of new methods of surveillance, security apparatuses, and technologies for protest and crowd control. <br />
Guests Zeese &amp; Flowers argue the US Empire’s increasing aggressiveness and violence in recent decades are indications of its growing weakness, not strength, as challenges to it mount worldwide. <br />
Events today in the Ukraine, Middle East, and Asia are discussed as points of resistance to empire outside the US. <br />
Recent events by China and the BRICS to establish a new ‘global development bank’ and bypass the US dollar in trade, as well as events in Latin America, are also noted as examples of growing resistance to Empire. <br />
The impact of Empire on the deterioration of USA democracy and 1st amendment rights at home are also addressed by Zeese &amp; Flowers, who identify points of resistance to Empire growing within the US.    
For more information concerning US based resistance to Empire, listeners are referred to the websites: popularresistance.org, rolllingrebellion.org, and to Zeeze &amp; Flowers’ latest article on the Alternet.org blog, ‘Why Resistance is Growing to the US Empire’.   
Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers are hosts of ‘Clearing the Fog’ radio (ClearingtheFogRadio.org) , members of the Green Shadow Cabinet (greenshadowcabinet.org), long time Washington DC area activists in the Occupy movement, and organizers of the blogs, Resistance.Org and ItsOurEconomy.<br />
US, that report on grass roots movements of resistance and opposition to attacks on democracy and inequality trends in the USA today.
