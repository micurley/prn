title: China’s Slowing Economy and Rising Financial Instability
---
“Dr. Rasmus takes a deep look into China’s economy, asking if it is heading for a ‘hard landing’?
<!--more-->
Will its growing financial bubbles soon burst? <br />
Rasmus discusses reasons why China’s economy is slowing, and its potential impacts on emerging markets, Europe, and the rest of the global economy. <br />
China’s growing financial instability is also explored, including the role of global shadow banks and the 200,000 richest ‘Ultra High Net Worth Individuals’ (aka biggest global finance capitalists and their primary financial institutions) stoking the financial bubbles and instability in China. <br />
 How are they together driving China’s currency and real estate bubbles? <br />
What’s China trying to do to slow speculation in its currency, local housing, and local investment markets?<br />
  Why is China total debt is now well above crisis levels? <br />
Are they driving China toward a ‘Lehman Moment’ financial crisis? <br />
Rasmus concludes with discussion of China’s recent shift to lower the value of its Yuan to ‘reign in’ the shadow banks and global speculators, and what that could mean if it loses control not only for China’s economic hard landing but for the world economy as well”.
