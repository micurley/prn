Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus will welcome two guests to discuss the defense budget and the likelihood (or unliklihood) it will be part of the massive multi-trillion dollar spending cuts that are coming immediately after the November 6 election regardless who wins.<br />
  How big is the defense  budget really? <br />
What is it costing us?<br />
  Can defense be provided with much less spending? <br />
Jack will welcome Michael Eisenscher, Co-Coordinator of US Labor Against the War, and Mike Prokasch of the ‘New Priorities Network’, both of whom have some ideas worth hearing.
<br />
