title: Is the Global Economy Recovering or Slowing?
---
To read the public and business press, it appears the US economy is about to accelerate, the Federal Reserve will soon<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

raise interest rates, unemployment is at pre-recession lows, wages are about to rise, housing is recovering. <br />
Meanwhile, Europe is growing again now that the Greek crisis is resolved; China has stabilized its stock marke;, and the rest of the world is on a recovery path. <br />
But this public spin to the current US and global economic scene does not conform to reality. <br />
Jack Rasmus takes listeners on an ‘economic tour’ of the realities in the US and global real economy, where the US continues on a sub-par ‘stop go’ recovery, where China is really growing at 4-5% GDP, not the announced 7%, where China’s stock market collapse, begun in June, has only paused before another turn lower, where Europe QE is failing to generate a sustainable recovery and the ‘Greek Crisis’ is far from over, where Japan’s real economy has stalled (again for the fifth time since 2008), and where emerging markets from Indonesia to Brazil to Turkey are slowing and slipping into recessions. <br />
The global oil deflation is entering another decline, global commodities prices and sales are falling further, currency instability is rising, and money capital is flowing back to the US from everywhere, raising rates in the US and slowing economies elsewhere as the US dollar rises. <br />
