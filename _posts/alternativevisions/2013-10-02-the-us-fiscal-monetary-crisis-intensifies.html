title: The US Fiscal-Monetary Crisis Intensifies
---
Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus provides his analysis on the current government shutdown and the repeat of the debt ceiling crisis coming by mid-October and their possible negative impacts on the economy. <br />
 Rasmus then considers the ‘other policy crisis’–ie the US Federal Reserve’s QE and zero interest rate monetary policies. <br />
He explains why US monetary policy has also entered a crisis stage in recent months–ie proving increasingly ineffective at stimulating the real economy while simultaneously generating financial bubbles. <br />
QE and austerity policies elsewhere in the world are discussed, with similar counterproductive effects on the real economy. <br />
Rasmus concludes the US and global economy is now entering a period of growing ineffectiveness of traditional fiscal-monetary policies generating a sustained economic recovery, at a time during which the US and global economies continue to slow or stagnate long term.<br />
