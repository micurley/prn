title: US Economy Stalls Again-4th Time in 4 years!

Jack Rasmus analyzes US 1st Quarter GDP numbers, where US economic growth flattened out to a mere 0.2%–the fourth such collapse in the US economy in as many years.<br />
  Is it due to the weather, as some argue? <br />
Is there something wrong with US statistics, showing four collapses since 2009 all occurring in the winter? <br />
Or are there real economic explanations for why the US economy periodically surges in the summer then stalls out in the winter, as it has since 2011? <br />
Will this winter 2015’s stall be followed by another ‘temporary surge’ in growth this summer?  Jack looks beneath the numbers for real explanations for the US economy’s continuing ‘stop-go’ trajectory, identifying patters of one-off, temporary factors that typically have occurred in the 3rd quarter (July-September), only to dissipate in the winter quarters, in turn leading to an over-correction and decline in US GDP and growth repeatedly.<br />
  It’s not the weather. <br />
It may be outmoded statistical methods by the US government. <br />
But it certainly is due to temporary events that don’t result in a sustained economy recovery, Jack argues.<br />
  Government pre-election spending, restoration of defense spending, business inventory buildups, the global oil glut and US oil shale boom &amp; bust, the US dollar decline and surge effects on US manufacturing-exports, diversion of US business investment into financial assets and offshore markets better account for the US stop-go trajectory, Jack argues. <br />
What’s missing is steady wage and income growth for 90% of US households and real job creating investment by business in the US.
