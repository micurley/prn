Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus welcomes back Art Stamoulis, Executive Director of Citizenstrade.<br />
org, to report on and discuss the latest developments in the ‘Free Trade on Steroids’ deal being pushed by Obama on behalf of transnational US corporations. <br />
With an agreement target date of October 2013 set by the US and negotiating parties, the free trade deal that will dwarf prior deals (NAFTA, CAFTA, etc.<br />
) to date, appears ‘wired’ and on its way to fast conclusion. <br />
What’s the impact on jobs, wages, environment, etc.<br />
  Also addressed: the parallel agreement, the TransAtlantic Partership, just announced by Obama, and a ‘Free Trade’ double whammy to US jobs, wages, environment, and sovereign democratic rights of US citizens.
<br />

Arthur Stamoulis is executive director of Citizens Trade Campaign, a national coalition of labor, environmental, family farm and consumer organizations that works together on questions of international trade policy. <br />
 Their current focus is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. <br />
 Citizens Trade Campaign organized demonstrations outside TPP negotiating rounds in Virginia, California, Texas and Illinois, and were the first to publish leaked text of several proposed TPP chapters. <br />
