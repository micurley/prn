Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus invites long time union representative and guest, Jerry Gordon, to report on the recent conference in New Jersey at which a ‘National Labor Fight Back Network’ was launched at the conference by more than 100 local union, community, and student leaders to take more aggressive action to stop cuts in social security, medicare, education, jobs, and other programs. <br />
Guest Jerry Gordon explains the new Labor Fightback Network has been formed with the goal of taking direct action—marches, protests, independent political organizing, etc.<br />
  Gordon describes the new organization’s program and mission statement, and potential future organizing activity. <br />
Not a political party or substitute for the trade union or community organizations, Gordon explains the Network seeks to play the role as an organizing tool for a new grass roots movement.  For more information and where to join and participate in the Network efforts, go to the website: laborfightback.<br />
