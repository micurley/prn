title: US Health Care Costs Again Rising–Not Slowing
---
Dr Jack Rasmus welcomes as his guest, Tom Moore, a nationally known expert on health care costs with 30 years<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
experience in medical cost analysis in government and as a consultant, to discuss rising health insurance premiums and costs today in the US.  Jack and Tom discuss why health care premiums and deductibles are again on the rise, and projected to escalate at double digit annual rates further in 2015 under Obamacare.<br />
  Dr Rasmus notes the sharp contradiction between national consumer polls and surveys that show health care insurance premiums and deductibles rising again at double digit levels vs. <br />
government and Obama administration reports that claim total healthcare spending in the US is slowing. <br />
So what is it? <br />
Are personal out of pocket costs rising and about to escalate even more—or are the government reports of total healthcare spending slowing correct? <br />
Are health insurance companies, that have become big finance companies expanding worldwide, about to rip off the US public again with double digit further premium and deductible hikes once Obamacare is implemented?<br />
  What can you expect in coming months. <br />
Jack and Tom discuss the details and the real data.<br />
