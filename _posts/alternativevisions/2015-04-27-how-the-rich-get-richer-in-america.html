title: How the Rich Get Richer in America

Jack Rasmus discusses the recent report that the wealthiest 1%, who own most of the stock in US corporations, will<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

receive more than $1 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts in 2015. <br />
Buybacks-dividends delivered $3.<br />
8 trillion since the end of the recession in 2009, with another trillion coming this year. <br />
And that’s only for the largest S&amp;P 500 corporations, Jack explains. <br />
Net profits for US corporations totaled more than $5 trillion since 2009 as well. <br />
Jack explains how that $5 trillion in profits derived from cost cutting, mostly labor costs, and rising corporate financial asset investment and speculation as well.  $5 trillion in profits minus $3.8 trillion in buybacks and dividend payouts, leaves about the $1.3 trillion remaining in undistributed profits still on corporate balance sheets, Jack explains.<br />
  That’s how the rich get richer in America. <br />
But that’s not how business, politicians and even liberal economists explain income inequality—choosing instead to focus on productivity, tax, CEO pay as causes. <br />
 None dare touch the corporation as the real source and the conduit for distribution of income and wealth to the 1%, Jack argues.  Jack concludes the show with another look at US GDP numbers that will be announced on April 29 for first quarter GDP, following up his comments on a prior April 4 show.<br />
  There may be a big surprise, he warns, with GDP collapsing again (for the fourth time) to near zero growth, as the USA continues on its ‘stop-go’ economic scenario and as the current 5-6 years of ‘recovery’ since the last recession reaches its final years.
