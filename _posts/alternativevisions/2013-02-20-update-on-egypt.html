 Jack Rasmus welcomes guest, Carl Finamore, journalist just returned  from Cairo during its recent anniversary demonstrations and protests  associated with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.<br />
  Jack will interview  Carl on what’s new in the fight for democracy in Egypt. <br />
Are the workers,  independent unions, students, women and unemployed youth raising social  and economic demands, or is the revolution mired in ‘business as usual’  now with the Islamic Brotherhood, and its leader, Mohammed Morsi,  replacing deposed Hosni Mubarak as point men for the IMF and western  economic interests? <br />
Has the revolution stalled? <br />
Are popular forces  defeated or just reforming to push future demands for real economic  change?
<br />

Jack’s  guest, Carl Finamore, has visited Egypt three times in the last several  years and in fact arrived on his first visit only two hours after  dictator Hosni Mubarak was thrown out of office on February 11, 2011. <br />
 Finamore is former president, retired, of Air Transport Employees, Local  Lodge 1781, IAMAW which represents airline workers at SFO and other  northern California airports. <br />
He is currently the Local’s delegate to  the San Francisco Labor Council, AFL-CIO. <br />
His writings appear on  CounterPunch, Zmagazine, InTheseTimes, TalkingUnion, Truthout and  numerous other alternative news outlets. <br />
He is available for speaking  engagements, he can be contacted at local1781@yahoo.com.<br />
