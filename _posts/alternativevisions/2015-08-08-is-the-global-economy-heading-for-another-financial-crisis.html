title: Is the Global Economy Heading for Another Financial Crisis?

Jack Rasmus follows up the previous show on the global economy with an assessment of financial instability that appears<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

to be growing globally as well. <br />
Jack briefly discusses how excess debt and income decline and stagnation basically cause financial instability, and explains how the new 200,000 or so global finance capital elite continue to create financial asset bubbles worldwide and how those bubbles appear to be converging. <br />
Financial bubbles that appear most unstable include China’s stock markets (Shanghai and Schenzhen), but also global oil and commodity futures, emerging market equity and bond markets, US and global bond ETFs sold by mutual funds, the US and Euro corporate junk bond markets, tech stocks, Eurozone banks, and currency exchange markets that are becoming much more volatile. <br />
Also noted are potential serious secondary effects of a lack of liquidity in bond markets in general and effects on US repo markets in turn. <br />
The show concludes with a in-depth look at causes behind the current China stock market collapse which, Jack argues, has yet to run its full course and could destabilize financial markets worldwide in the near future. <br />
The role of China government policies in causing a runup of 120% in China stocks in just one year is explained, as well as government measures introduced since June 12 of this year to stop the stock slide.
