title: Why Austerity Continues—When It Clearly Doesn’t Work.
---
Jack Rasmus takes a look at why Austerity policies were introduced in 2008-09 and why they continue still today,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

evolving into new forms, despite their proven negative impact on economic recovery.  Jack challenges liberal economists like Paul Krugman who lament the continuation of such policies, explaining Liberals don’t understand the purpose and function of austerity policies, which are integral to capitalist  recovery strategies since 2008.<br />
  Austerity is the complement to a primary focus in advanced capitalist economies on monetary policy as the preferred strategy for economic recovery—ie central banks’ bailouts of private banks and investors via QE, zero rates, auctions and forward guidelines. <br />
While monetary policy is primary, austerity is a necessary complement, Jack explains, to bank bailouts which produce slow, intermittent, and 5-10 year or more economic recovery trajectories. <br />
Jack looks at how Austerity has functioned so far in Europe, USA, Japan and now Ukraine, why it has continued and why it will continue, morphing in to new forms.<br />
  Austerity policy is a class policy and integral to capitalists’ view of how recovery should be engineered, Jack explains. <br />
That’s why Krugman and others don’t understand why it continues.<br />
  (Next week’s show is  ‘Back to the Future’, a detailed look at the new Republican Congress’s 10 priorities for the next two years, that are just a rehash and resurrection of George W. <br />
Bush policies in new form going forward).
