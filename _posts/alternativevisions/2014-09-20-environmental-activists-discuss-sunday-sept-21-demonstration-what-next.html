title: Environmental Activists Discuss Sunday, Sept. 21 Demonstration & What Next
---
Jack Rasmus welcomes environmental activists, Michael Rubin and Glenn Turner, to discuss tomorrow’s major environment<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
movement event, the demonstration in New York City and elsewhere in the USA (and globally) advocating the need for reducing global green house gas emissions to avoid a coming global environmental catastrophe.<br />
  Jack and guests discuss the significance and the demands of the Sept. <br />
21 events. <br />
Jack challenges guests to clarify the demands and future strategic objectives of the USA environmental movement.  What comes next, after Sunday?<br />
  Will the many environmental groups continue to unify or continue after Sunday to lead their separate struggles, only occasionally coming together for demonstrations that make no specific demands for change on the system. <br />
Will they unite with other groups and forces outside the environmental community—ie unions, community and ethnic groups, student organizations, religious organizations, forming a ‘united front’ to confront the destruction of the environment and ultimately the economy as well?<br />
  Listen to the lively discussion, as Jack plays ‘devils advocate’ challenging environmental activists to evolve to a higher level of political action.
