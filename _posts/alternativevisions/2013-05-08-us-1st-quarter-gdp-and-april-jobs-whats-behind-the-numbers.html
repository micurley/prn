title: 'US 1st Quarter GDP and April Jobs: What’s Behind the Numbers'
---
Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus continues with his series on predicting the future direction of the US economy.<br />
  Today’s show consider in depth and detail the recent 1st Quarter GDP numbers as well as last week’s April jobs report. <br />
Dr Rasmus explains how average GDP real per capita growth the past nine months is really only about 1%, after adjusted properly for real inflation and after temporary factors in each of the last three quarters are accounted for.<br />
  April jobs numbers were also far weaker than reported, with the majority of jobs part time or temporary. <br />
The US job market long term is also ‘marking time’, churning out permanent for part time/temp, high wage for low wage, and new hires for millions leaving the labor force.
<br />
Next week, May 15, Dr Rasmus discusses the economy with Rick Wolff, Shadow Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, of the just formed Green Shadow Cabinet
<br />
