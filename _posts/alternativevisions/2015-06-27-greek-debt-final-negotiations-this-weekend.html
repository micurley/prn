title: Greek Debt Final Negotiations This Weekend

Jack Rasmus reports on the final positions of the Greek government and the Troika (IMF, ECB, EC) as they enter<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

negotiations this weekend, June 27-28, before the expiration of the current debt payments on June 30 and a possible default on the debt.  Jack reviews the most recent positions of the Greeks, provided last week in a comprehensive 11page document, which was rejected by the Troika on June 24 in toto, the failed negotiations at the highest levels on June 25-26, and the two sides’ demands as last minute negotiations occur June 27-28.  The highly class nature of the negotiations are noted—with pensions (deferred wages), sales taxation (impacting workers more), Troika opposition to tax the rich, and Troika demand for full privatizations.<br />
  The Troika’s emerging ‘Plan B’ is described (ie push Greece to default and maneuver a regime change) vs. <br />
the missing Greek ‘Plan B’ (establish a parallel currency to the Euro) are contrasted.  The five major negotiating errors that the Greek government has committed since March are described.  The most likely scenario to the final deal on June 30 is outlined—based on extending the negotiations for months more, Troika paying itself for debt with funds it has been denying Greece, in exchange for more concessions still from Greece.<br />
