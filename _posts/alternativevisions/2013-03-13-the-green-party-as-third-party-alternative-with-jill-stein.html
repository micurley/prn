title: The Green Party as Third Party Alternative with Jill Stein
---
Dr.
<!--more-->
Jack Rasmus interviews 2012 Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, as part of the show’s on-going discussion with alternative political parties.  Jill explains what’s new with the Green party since last year’s elections: New gains by the party, new coalitions at the grass roots with Occupy and other parties, initiatives at the college and local level and new membership influx.<br />
  Jack asks Ms. <br />
Stein, what’s different about the Green Party’s strategy and tactics compared to other third party initiatives.
<br />
Next week’s Alternative Visions show will focus on the new budget proposals of the House Republicans and the Obama administration, plans to cut social security and medicare while restoring defense cuts by both, and what alternatives are possible. <br />
For the latter, see Dr Rasmus’s recent speech of Feb. <br />
28 to the Progressive Democrats of America posted on the PRN website or on his website, www.kyklosproductions.com/videos.<br />
