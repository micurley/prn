A look at some of the more dark elements in American history during the last century that gave shape to the US being<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

perceived as an empire – and what this means for america’s future
Prof. <br />
Peter Kuznick is a professor of history at American University in Washington DC where he is also serves as the director of the university’s Nuclear Studies Institute.<br />
  He has specialized American political history, the history of nuclear science, and the Cold war.
<br />
Prof. <br />
Kuznick is the co-author with academy award winning film director Oliver Stone of the New York Times bestseller “The Untold History of the United States”, which is the basis for the television series with the same title on Showtime.<br />
  In the revisionist tradition of Howard Zinn, Morris Berman and others, Peter’s and Oliver’s research focuses the darker elements that shaped the US during the past century into the present moment whereby today the US is commonly regarded as an empire, with imperialist ambitions around the world. <br />
The question is: what were the events that drove the country to be identified as an imperium and were alternatives present during the past 100 years that would have transformed the US into a more peaceful and less militaristic nation?
