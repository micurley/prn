creating movement to connect children to the natural world. <br />
He is also an honorary chairman of Canada’s national Children and Nature Alliance. <br />
He is perhaps best known for coining the term Nature Deficit Disorder through his book The Last Child in the Woods, which has now been translated into ten languages and has spearheaded a shift in consciousness in how children are being raised.<br />
  He has received many awards including the Audubon Medal.
<br />
In the past Richard was a columnist for The San Diego Union-Tribune for 27 years and has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Times of London, and other major publications
His newest book is “The Nature Principle:  Reconnecting with Life in a Virtual Age” which expores Nature Deficit Disorder’s affects on adults and our society at large, while also offering a new future vision for re-immersing ourselves in nature to bring an end to this condition.<br />
