repercussions on the world economy, food and transportation, and the need to transition away from fossil fuels and create a more sustainable future. <br />
He is currently the Senior Fellow at the Post Carbon Institute in Northern California. <br />
 He was featured in Leonardo DiCaprio’s film “The Eleventh Hour” and frequently appears on major media networks to address our fossil fuel based culture and the future of climate change.

Richard is the author of many books, including “The Party’s Over” which has become  a standard text for the peak oil position.
<br />
His most recent book is “The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality” which concisely lays out the limitations of our present global economy and the fact it has now reached a fateful turning point where our recession will not end in “recovery”.
