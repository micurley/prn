Who is starting a new Cold war, Obama or Russia? With Dmitry Orlov.

Dmitry Orlov is a Russian-American engineer and author writing on the potential economic, environmental and political decline and collapse of the US and modern industrial culture. <br />
He was an eye witness to the collapse of the Soviet Union and has researched extensively its causes and the reasons for the failure of both the Soviets and the Americans to predict and understand it accurately. <br />
Dmirty is very popular among the Peak Oil community such as Richard Heinberg and frequently writes on the looming energy crisis.
<br />
He has written several books, most notably Reinventing Collapse and now his most recent “The Five Stages of Collapse: Survivors Toolkit.” He publishes weekly on his popular blog ClubOrolv.<br />
com and for the Energy Bulletin. <br />
Dmitry and his family currently live on a sailboat fitted with solar panels and the necessities to carry them through for months.
