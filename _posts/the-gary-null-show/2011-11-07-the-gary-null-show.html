Justin Frank MD is a psychoanalyst practicing in  Washington DC and a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at George Washington University Medical Center.<br />
  Trained at Harvard Medical School, he has practiced for over 30 years and is also the co-Director of the Metropolitan Center for Object Relations in NYC.
<br />
His book “Bush on the Couch” was a best seller and detailed the psychological rationale for confirming President Bush was a president of poor mental health, unsuited for the office.
<br />
His very recent book, “Obama on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President” promises to do same in explaining the inconsistencies and weaknesses of President Obama and the reasons why Obama the Campaigner seems to be so distinct from Obama the President.
