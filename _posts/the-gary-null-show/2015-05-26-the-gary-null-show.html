disobedience — with Chris Hedges.<br />
 
Chris Hedges is one of our nation’s most insightful cultural critics, social and political activists and investigative journalists. <br />
For almost 20 years he was a foreign correspondent in war zones and conflicts in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans, having reported for The New York Times, Christian Science Monitor and other news outlets. <br />
While at the Times, Chris received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on global terrorism. <br />
That same year he received Amnesty International’s Global Award for Human Rights Journalism. <br />
Over the years he has taught at Columbia, Princeton, NYU and the University of Toronto.
<br />
Chris has authored many bestselling books. <br />
Next week, a new one will be released entitled “Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt”, a philosophical, historical and timely exploration into the causes and clarion call for a new revolution against a repressive political and corporate hegemony. <br />
Chris’ weekly column can also be read every Monday at Truthdig.com<br />
