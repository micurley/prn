educated in Edinburgh University in Scotland. <br />
She has written for Nature, The British Medical Journal, The Scientist, Reuters Health and the Guardian. <br />
As a European correspondent for Renewable Energy World, she learned of the possible connection between the big pharmaceutical firm Baxter, the World Health Organization and the new strain of H1N1 swine flu virus appearing on the global arena. <br />
After filing criminal suit against Baxter and the WHO on bioterrorism charges, she was dismissed from her reporting position. <br />
Her charges have been supported by some upstanding physicians who have also explored criminal activity between Big Pharma, the WHO, UN and high ranking government officials.
