A look at our nation’s “sacrifice zones” as evidence of rapid soci-economic decay across the US.
Chris Hedges is one of<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
our nation’s most insightful cultural critics and authors. <br />
For almost 20 years he was a foreign correspondent in war zones and conflicts in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans, having reported for The New York Times, Christian Science Monitor and other news outlets. <br />
 While at the Times, Chris received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on global terrorism. <br />
The same year he received Amnesty International’s Global Award for Human Rights Journalism.
<br />
Chris’s most recent book, co-written with the renowned cartoonist and author Joe Sacco, is “Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt”  – which takes a hard look at areas in the US that are the “sacrifice zones” – where the well being of people have been most impoverished in the name of profit and progress. <br />
 He also writes a weekly column for the award winning political blog Truthdig.
