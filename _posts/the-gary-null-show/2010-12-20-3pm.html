Daniel Ellsberg and he is a former military analyst  for the Rand Corporation who released the highly controversial political documents that led to the unveiling of secrets and motivations, cover-ups, behind the Vietnam war. <br />
His publication of the Pentagon Papers ultimately contributed to Watergate and the removal of President Nixon. <br />
 Since then, Daniel continues to be one of the nation’s most outspoken anti-war activists, speaking out against our invasion and strategy in Afghanistan, American militarism in the Middle East, earlier supporting the impeachment of George W Bush,  the humanitarian threats still looming from nuclear weapons. <br />
  This year, a documentary about him and the Pentagon Papers – “The Most Dangerous Man in America” was nominated for an Oscar. <br />
  Daniel has received many awards, including the prestigious Gandhi Peace Award and the alternative noble Right Livelihood Award.
