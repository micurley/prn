Guests: Ian Henshall and Barbara Honegger
Ian Henshall is a British based investigative journalist and author whose<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

book “911 Revealed: The New Evidence” has raised a lot of voices across Europe. <br />
 The London times noted the detailed scrutiny Ian applied to the official government versions of 911 and the inconsistencies discovered throughout it. <br />
 The US State Department must have been fully alarmed by it since only 5 days after the book’s release it went out of its way to attack it. <br />
The book gives clear explanations about  explosives used to bring down the towers, a military drone craft and missile hitting the pentagon, the controversy over cell-phne calls… the inconsistencies in the official stories about the hijackings.

Barbara Honegger worked as a researcher at the Hoover Institution before joining the Ronald Reagan administration as a researcher and policy analyst in 1980.
<br />
While working for Reagan she discovered information that convinced her that George H. <br />
W. <br />
Bush and William Casey had conspired to make sure that Iran did not release the US hostages until Jimmy Carter had been defeated in the 1980 presidential election.
<br />
In 1987 Honegger began leaking information to journalists about the Reagan administration, which was published in her book October Surprise.
<br />
In recent years she has been tackling the 911 issues, with a particular emphasis on looking at the 911 attack on the Pentagon.
