 He has defeated the Food and Drug Administration a remarkable six times in federal court, more times than any other attorney in American history, earning him the title, “FDA Dragon Slayer.”  In 2007 he received the Cancer Control Society’s Humanitarian Award for “winning and preserving our great civil rights to life, to liberty, and to health freedoms.<br />
”  Jonathan is the Chair of the Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists and a member of the Governing Council of the International Society of Regulatory Toxicology. <br />
 Formerly an attorney in the Reagan Administration’s Federal Communications Commission, Emord has practiced constitutional and administrative law in Washington, DC for the past twenty-five years. <br />
 He is routinely consulted by industry, Congress, and the media on regulatory issues that affect health freedom. <br />
 He is the author of several critically acclaimed books including The Ultimate Price (2007); The Rise of Tyranny (2008); and Global Censorship of Health Information (2010). <br />
