Steven Druker (Drooker) is a public interest attorney and founder of the Alliance for Bio-Integrity – a nonprofit<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
organization dedicated to the advancement of human and environmental health through sustainable and safe technologies.<br />
  Steven was the initiator of a lawsuit against the FDA over the approval of GMOs in violation of federal safety codes. <br />
Although the case was lost, it nevertheless resulted in the release of 10s of 1000s of pages from the FDA files proving illegal wrongdoing in favor of the biotech industry and Monsanto.  Steven is now international speaker on consumer interests and protections, especially against GMO and its biotechnology and meets with government heads worldwide to warn of food safety threats.  He is the author of “Altered Genes , Twisted Truth” which details the lawsuit over GMOs and reveals the critical issues from the damaging documentation he received during the legal proceedings.  His website is BioIntegrity.org
