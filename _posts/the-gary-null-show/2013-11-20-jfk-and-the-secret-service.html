Vince Palamara became interested in the JFK assassination at the age of twelve and later realized that very little attention in the conspiracy literature gave attention to the Secret Service agency, which is assigned to protect Presidents.<br />
  He has become the leading civilian authority on Secret Service history and protocol. <br />
Vince’s research led him to personally contact over 80 individuals including former Secret Service agents, White House aides and surviving members of the Kennedy family. <br />
His research has been compiled in a recent new addition of his book “Survivor’s Guilt: The Secret Service and the JFK Murder” 
 
Vince earlier book, “JKF: The Medical Evidence Reference” is regarded as one of the most thorough texts on the physical examination of the medical forensics and coverup following Kennedy’s death.  His website is VincePalamara.blogspot.<br />
