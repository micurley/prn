Today’s guest is Dr. Tim Flannery and he has been considered one of the most famous scientists of our time.
<!--more-->
He is an Australian mammalogist, palaeontologist, ecologist and global warming activist. <br />
He was among the first scientists in the world to sound the alarm for tackling the problem of climate change. <br />
In addition to his professorship at MacQuarie University, he is also Australia’s first Chief Commissioner for Climate Change. <br />
He is believed to have discovered more new species of life than Darwin. <br />
Dr Flannery holds many prestigious positions and posts: the Australian representative for National Geographic, director of Australia’s Wildlife Conservancy, chair of the Copenhagen Climate Council. <br />
As an anti-war activist, he is a member of the Soldiers for Peace project to end all wars.
<br />
He was awarded Australian of the Year for his stance on climate change and advocating for the shutting down of coal energy plants – extremely controversial in Australia where the country depends mostly on coal for its energy. <br />
 His writings on climate change and the future of the global environment while offering hope, also are dire warnings.
<br />
Tim has published well over a dozen books and numerous papers. <br />
His most recent book, and perhaps his most all encompassing on a global scale, is “Here on Earth: A Natural History of the Planet.”
