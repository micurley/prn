Secretive activities of the School of Americas during Obama’s term and attempts to cease its operations
Father Roy<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Bourgeois is a priest of the Maryknoll Order of the Catholic Church and is the leading activist founder of the human rights groups School of the America’s Watch in Washington DC. <br />
 He is veteran of the Vietnam era having received a Purple Heart and since 1972 he has worked on behalf of the poor in Latin American countries under martial dictatorships. <br />
During that time he became an outspoken critic of US foreign policy in Latin America and spent over four years in US federal prisons for non-violent protests. <br />
IN 1990, Father Roy founded the School of America’s Watch which has now been renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, headquarted at Fort Benning Georgia – a secretive school that trains hundreds of Latin American soldiers, police and officers in combat skills – all paid for by the US taxpayer.
<br />
Father Roy’s many protests and accomplishments are too numerous to recount. <br />
 Yet among his many awards are the Gandhi Peace Award, the Thomas Merton Award and the Pax Christi USA Pope Paul the Sixth Teacher of Peace Award.
