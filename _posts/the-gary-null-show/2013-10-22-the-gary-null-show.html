Prof.
<br />
 Norman Pollack is a professor emeritus of history at Michigan State 
University in East Lansing Michigan. <br />
He has a long history of engaging 
civil rights and anti-war activities over the decades, beginning when he
 was 15 and campaigning for Henry Wallace and his Progressive Party in 
1948. <br />
 Later he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson in the 50s and supported 
Martin Luther King. <br />
A two time Guggenheim fellow, Prof. <br />
Pollack was a 
major intellectual voice during the late 60s in giving an knowledgeable 
boost to the New Left and writing on American populism, which became an 
popular documentary “The Populist Mind”. <br />
 After receiving his doctorate 
in American Civilization from Harvard, he taught at Yale and Wayne State
 before going to Michigan. <br />
In his later years he has focused on the 
history of civil disobedience, socio-political alienation, and the 
sociology of fascism. <br />
Prof. <br />
Pollack currently writes for Counterpunch, 
looking at the identifying characteristics of America’s descent into a 
new form of neoliberal fascist state.
