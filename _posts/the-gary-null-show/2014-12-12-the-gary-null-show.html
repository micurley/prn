Dr Harold Koenig is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at an associate professor of medicine at Duke University’s Medical Center, and is a founder and director of Duke’s Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health – a multidisciplinary research and training program that explores the biological mechanisms by which religion and spirituality affect physical health and medical outcomes.  Earlier, Dr Koenig specialized in geriatric and family medicine.<br />
