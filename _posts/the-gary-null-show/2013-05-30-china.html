Newsmaker: An initiative to permanent shut down Indian Point due to increased likelihood of a hydrogen explosion in the event of a meltdown
Mark Leyse is a nuclear safety consultant, who researched and wrote Riverkeeper’s enforcement action petition, dated November 14, 2012, requesting that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission order the Indian Point nuclear power plant to be shutdown permanently. <br />
 The petition cites safety analyses indicating that hydrogen produced in the event of a meltdown could detonate and breach one of Indian Point’s reactor containment buildings, causing a large radiological release to the environment.
<br />
Leyse has also worked as a consultant for other environmental organizations, including Natural Resources Defense Council. <br />
 He is also the author of the NRDCs recent research and investigative report, “Preventing Hydrogen Explosion at Indian Point Nuclear Plant: Fact versus Industry Spin”
