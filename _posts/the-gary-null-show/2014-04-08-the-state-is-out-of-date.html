into our own hands
Gregory Sams has been changing modern corporate culture from the age of 19, when he operated the historic natural and organic Seed Restaurant in London in the 1960’s. <br />
Within a few years he ran the nation’s first and foremost natural and organic food enterprises. <br />
In 1982 he created and christened the original VegeBurger and helped steer the market for vegetarian food and founded Whole Earth Foods.<br />
 Greg was founding publisher of Harmony Magazine and later Seed: The Journal of Organic Living and has been one of the early proponents of Chaos Theory. <br />
He has authored several books, most recently“The State is Out of Date – We Can Do It Better” which outlines the weaknesses in relying upon the State and corporations to do anything right and to take our own survival and sustainability into our own hands. <br />
