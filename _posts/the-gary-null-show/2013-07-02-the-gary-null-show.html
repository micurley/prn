Dr.

Bruce Lipton is an international authority on the new emerging biology into cellular activity and on the interface between science and spirituality. <br />
From 1987 to 1992 he was a researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine. <br />
Among his discoveries was identifying a mechanism in cells that function like a brain and the founding of a field of cellular biology known as epigenetics. <br />
Dr Lipton is now recognized as one of the leading voices in the New Biology and Mind-Body Medicine.
<br />
His book The Biology of Belief has been a landmark work uniting mind-body and cellular science with spirituality.<br />
  His most recent book is “the Honeymoon Effect: The Science of Creating Heaven on Earth“, which applies the principles of most recent realizations from epigenetics, molecular biology and quantum physics to understanding the positive and negative psychologies enacted in love and relationships. <br />
His website is BruceLipton.com<br />
