Judy Wood is a former professor at Clemson University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, specializing in the research of thermal stress and deformation analysis with optical imaging, biomaterial composition, and biomimicry. <br />
 She is an expert in the field of interferometry, an optical method of stress analysis to determine interference patterns and their effects. <br />
She has authored over 60 peer reviewed research papers.
<br />
Dr Wood has applied her scientific expertise, since the time of 911, to conduct what is probably the most thorough forensic study on the collapse of the world trade towers – based on over 40,000 images, video clips, volumes of witness testimonies. <br />
Her findings led her to file a federal qui tam case for science fraud against the contractors who controlled the official 911 Commission report. <br />
 Her research has been published in a 500 page book, “Where Did the Towers Go?: Evidence of Directed Free-Energy Technology on 911.”
