Guests: Kevin Annett and Dee Nicholson


Kevin Annett is a former minister of the United Church of Canada, who was<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

defrocked for his pursuing investigations and research into the holocaust of native American children – which has become better known as Canada’s genocide. <br />
 His publications which include “Hidden From History: The Canadian Holocause” and later “Love and Death in the Valley” have created much of storm in the Anglican Church. <br />
 So much he was denied entry into England in May of this year, being held briefly in an immigration prison before being deported.
<br />
 
Kevin’s remarkable, well-documented research was the theme of his documentary film “Unrepentant: Kevin Annett and Canada’s Genoscide” – which earned him Best Director award at the 2006 New York International Independent Film Festival.
<br />


Dee Nicholson is the Executive Director of the National Health Federation of Canada – the world’s oldest health freedom organization and the sole health freedom organization represented on the Codex Alimentarius commission. <br />
 She has been public relations consultant and a seasoned activist for many years both in the US and Canada. <br />

 
Because the Canadian health care system treats Native Americans differently than non-Indians  – for example, mandatory flu vaccinations on reservations – Dee’s organization is leader in lobbying for Native American health rights.<br />
