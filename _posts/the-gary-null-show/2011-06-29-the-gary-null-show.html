his research on the interface between various organisms, particularly humans and other species, and their relationship to disease and illness. <br />
 What is novel in Prof. <br />
Dunn’s research is his openness to challenge the assumptions science makes about the roles and functions of organisms surrounding us and a willingness to state, there is much we don’t know.
<br />
Besides articles in peer-reviewed publications, Rob’s writings have appeared in Natural History, BBC Wildlife Magazine, Scientific American and National Geographic. <br />
He has received the Naitonal Outdoor Book Award for best Natural History writing and his most recent book, “The Wild Life of Our Bodies: Predators, Parasites and Partners That Shape Who We Are Today” goes into depth on the history within evolutionary biology to establish the long relationship between humans and other species and their effects on our health.
