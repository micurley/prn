The pending social and economic disintegration ahead and what can be done to lessen or survive it?
<!--more-->
Dmitry Orlov is a Russian-American engineer and author writing on the potential economic, environmental and political decline and collapse of the US and modern industrial culture.<br />
  He was an eye witness to the collapse of the Soviet Union and has researched extensively its causes and the reasons for the failure of both the Soviets and the Americans to predict and understand it accurately. <br />
Dmirty is very popular among the Peak Oil community such as Richard Heinberg and frequently writes on the looming energy crisis. 
He has written five books, notably “The Five Stages of Collapse: Survivors Toolkit,”  and more recently collections of essays under the titles “Societies that Collapse” and “Communities that Abide.”  He publishes weekly on his popular blog ClubOrlov.<br />
com and for the Energy Bulletin. <br />
Dmitry and his family currently live on a sailboat fitted with solar panels and the necessities to carry them through for many months.<br />
