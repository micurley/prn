Dr Webster Tarpley is a philosopher of history, economist, and a renown critic of US foreign and domestic policy.<br />
  As an activist historian he first became widely known for his book George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography which is regarded as a masterpiece of research. <br />
He has degrees from Princeton and Skidmore, he was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Turin in Italy, and holds a doctorate in history from Catholic University. <br />
A decades-long expert on international terrorism, Dr Tarpley’s 1978 study commissioned by an Italian government minister — Who Killed Aldo Moro? <br />
— broke open the ownership of the Red Brigades by NATO’s clandestine networks.
<br />
In 2008, Dr Tarpley warned of the dangers of an Obama presidency controlled by Wall Street with two books Obama: The Postmodern Coup, The Making of a Manchurian Candidate and Barack H. <br />
Obama: The Unauthorized Biography – both having proven to remarkably accurate as we reflect back upon the past 4 years.
<br />
He has just released a new book  — hot off the press — “Just Too Weird: Bishop Romney and the Mormon Takeover of America”  that exposes in great detail the Mormon background of Bishop Mitt Romney, the history of the extended Romney family clan within the Mormon Church hierarchy, and a compelling analysis for why it was so difficult for Americans to understand who this man really is and why a Romney presidency would have been disastrous to the nation.
