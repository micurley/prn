survive. <br />
With David Ray Griffin
Professor David Ray Griffin is a professor emeritus of the philosophy of religion and a specialist in Process Theology Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University in Southern California.  He has published over 30 books raging from the interface of theology and science, the natural world, environmentalism and is best known for his decade worth of investigations in the anomalies of events on 911.  More recently his attention has been on the threats to human civilization from climate change and global warming, which he regards as the greatest threat humanity faces today.  He has just released a new extensive volume – “Unprecedented: Can Civilization Survive the CO2 crisis?<br />
” – which provides just about everything anyone needs to know about the science supporting climate change, the main failures and challenges of presidents, political parties, economists, corporations and the media, the deeper moral and spiritual questions, and potential solutions to be undertaken without delay. <br />
