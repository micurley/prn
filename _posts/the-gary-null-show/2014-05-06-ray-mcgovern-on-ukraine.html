CONVERSATIONS WITH REMARKABLE MINDS
What is going on in Ukraine..
<!--more-->
and who is in control of the White House’s Ukraine-Russian agenda
Ray McGovern served as an Army intelligence officer and a CIA analyst under 7 presidential administration, from the John F. <br />
Kennedy White House to that of George H. <br />
W. <br />
Bush. <br />
Among his duties was preparing the President’s Daily Brief, which was a one-on-one to President Ronald Reagan’s most senior national security advisers.<br />
 He was responsible for the analysis of Soviet intelligence regarding Vietnam. <br />
Since retiring from government service, he has been one of our nation’s most vocal peace activists and journalists. <br />
In 2003, he helped create Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) to expose the way intelligence was being falsified to “justify” war on Iraq.
<br />
Ray’s opinion pieces appear in many leading newspapers here and abroad, including a major section in an important book, “Neocon’d Again” dealing with America’s war in Iraq. He holds degrees in theology and philosophy from Fordham University, is a graduate from Harvard Business School and has a certificate of theology from Georgetown University. <br />
