Today’s guest is Dr.
<!--more-->
Robert Ornstein and he has been a leading pioneer in brain research and deep psychology for over 4 decades. <br />
When we speak of right-left hemisphere brain function, we are in fact referring to the findings of Dr Ornstein’s research. <br />
In 1969 he founded the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge which he still directs, and he has been a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford. <br />
His later work into the nature of mind and consciousness led to very important books, such as The Evolution of Consciousness, including the introduction of spiritual consciousness in a scientific manner, that led to an entire new direction in psychological practice and was instrumental in bringing spirituality and psychology together.
<br />
His most recent book, co-written with Paul Ehrilich of the Population Bomb fame, and a recent guest on this program, is “Humanity on a Tightrope: Thoughts on Empathy, Family and Big Changes for a Viable Future.
