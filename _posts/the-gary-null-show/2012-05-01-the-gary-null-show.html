Isha Judd is a author and teacher of spirituality originally from Australia but now living in Uruguay.
<!--more-->
She is the founder of Isha Educating for Peace, a self-funded non-governmental organization that provides free teachings throughout South America. <br />
The organizations works with the underprivileged and destitute, children, politicians, prisoners, and people with disabilities. <br />
In 2010, Isha provided teachings to over 6,000 people affected by the earthquakes in the south of Chile. <br />
She was recently named Ambassador for Peace by the Argentinean Senate, and Citizen of the World by the International University of Cuernavaca, Mexico.
<br />
Her most recent book just being released today is “Love Has Wings: Free Yourself from Limiting Beliefs and Fall in Love with Life” which focuses on how beliefs keep us stuck in situations of uncertainty – personal and global – and how to shift our perspective to feel able to make constructive differences in how we act, think and speak.
