the first wave of women originators behind what is now called “eco-feminism”. <br />
 Her writings have focused on such diverse, but interrelated topics, as social justice, ecological philosophy and Green politics, feminism and spirituality and religion. <br />
 The British government’s Department of the Environment named her among the one hundred eco-heroes of all time. <br />
Charlene is currently a professor of women’s spirituality at the California Institute for Integral Studies, a research fellow at the Green Institute and an adjunct professor at Schumacher College in the UK, founded by the gandhian scholar and mystic Satish Kumar who has been a guest on this program.
<br />
Charlene has published books as wide ranging as the goddesses of the Greeks, the role of the feminine in Christianity, social and historical criticism of modern culture, and environmental and green philosophy. <br />
 Her most recent book is “Relational Reality: New Discoveries of Interrelatedness that are Transforming the Modern World” which challenges the older mechanistic view of the universe and society that continues to dominate our major dominant institutions.
