<!--more-->
Wistar Janney and his family was intimately involved with many of Washington’s social and political elite including the family of the high CIA official Cord Meyer, whose wife Mary Pinchot Meyer would become President John Kennedy’s mistress and close confidant. <br />
Janney himself was best friends with one of Mary’s sons (who died in an accident at an early age), and knew the Meyer family personally. <br />
Mary would later be found murdered in park near Georgetown in Washington DC eleven months after the JFK assassination.
<br />
 
In 1992, Janney met Leo Damore, an author researching Mary Meyer and the controversy surrounding her unsolved death. <br />
Damore committed suicide under mysterious circumstances in 1995, his book never completed.  Peter continued Damore’s research and his personal leads after acquiring the late author’s files.<br />
  Peter’s book, “Mary’s Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace” reveals previously unknown information about the CIA’s role in the Kennedy’s death and the murder of the woman who JFK wanted to divorce Jackie for.
<br />
Peter graduated from Princeton University,  received a doctorate in psychology from Boston University, an MBA from Duke University and has a psychological practice in Boston.  His website is MarysMosaic.net
