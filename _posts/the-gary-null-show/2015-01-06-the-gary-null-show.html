Prof.
<!--more-->
Mitchell Stephens is a professor at the Arthur L Carter Journalism Institute at New York University where he teaches journalism and cultural reporting and criticism. <br />
He has written extensively on the history and development of journalism. <br />
His book “History of News” was the New York Times “Notable Book of the Year.<br />
”  In addition to writing numerous articles on the media, contemporary  reporting and broadcasting, and the challenges of traditional journalism due to the internet, which have appeared in major publications such as the New York Times, Washington Post and the Columbia Journalism Review, Prof. <br />
Stephens has written several textbooks on reporting news stories.  In more recent years, his attention has been on the need for a new expression of journalism and news reporting, which he calls “Wisdom Journalism” – a form of interpretive journalism that not only reports the facts but gives the news contextual meaning and news potential consequences are larger issues.  His most recent book is “Beyond News: the Future of Journalism” (Columbia University Press)<br />
