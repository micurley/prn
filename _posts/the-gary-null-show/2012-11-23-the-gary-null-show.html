shills are enemies of health in supporting faulty and dangerous medicine. <br />
Sayer Ji also adressses a less publicised story publushed by the prestigious, New England Medical Journal; For the past 30 years, 1.3 million women were overdiagnosed for breast cancer due to mammographic screening.<br />
  IN 2008 alone, 70,000 women were overdiagnosed which accounted for over 30 percent of all breast cancers. <br />
 The New England Medical Journal deliberatly published this on Thanksgiving so it would be under the radar to the  general public.
