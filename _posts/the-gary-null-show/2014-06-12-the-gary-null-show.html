Divisions in the climate change community over severity and timeframe of runaway global warming
Dr.
<!--more-->
Guy McPherson is a professor emeritus of Natural Resources, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.<br />
  He has specialized in forest resources, energy decline and climate change and their economic consequences. <br />
In the past he has also taught at Texas A&amp;M and University of California at Berkeley.
<br />
Having become disillusioned with the American university environment and academia, and after attempts by university officials to silence his outspokenness about the human causes of climate change, Guy abandoned his tenured position as a full professor for ethical reasons of conscience.
<br />
He is the author of two books, a personal memoir entitled “Walking Away from Empire” and “Going Dark,” which raises the big questions about humanity’s capability to determine its survival with advent of climate change.  Guy’s website is  GuyMcpherson.com
