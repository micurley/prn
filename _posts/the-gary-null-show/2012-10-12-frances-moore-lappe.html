is the author of 16 books, including her 1971 bestseller Diet for a Small Planet which influenced millions of people about the causes of hunger and the food choices we make. <br />
 Since then Frances has become one of the nation’s  leading social activists and an invaluable intellectual resource and visionary for a new democratic social movement. <br />
Towards this end, she has founded the Small Planet Institute and the Center for Living Democracy. <br />
  She has received numerous awards including the Right Livelihood Award (the Alternative Nobel Prize).
<br />
Frances most recent book is “EcoMind: Changing the Way We Think to Create the World We Want” which argues that instead of becoming overcome by fear, guilt and despair towards our environmental and social crises, we need to make efforts to alter our mental constructs to embrace a commitment to positive action.
