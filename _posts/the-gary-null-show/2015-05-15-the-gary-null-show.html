over 25 years, with an emphasis on disadvantaged youth, family abuse, the child welfare system and education. <br />
Joachim attended the US Military Academy at West Point through a Congressional appointment in the late 1960s.<br />
  After clashing with the system he was railroaded out at the end of his third year. <br />

This case set the precedent that continues today for cadets the have the right to present their case and witness before the academy. <br />
Joachim’s story is retold in his manuscript book “Don’t Let The Bastards Getcha Down.<br />
