Prof. <br />
Jennice Vilhauer is an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University’s School of Medicine, and the director of Emory’s Outpatient Psychotherapy Program, where she specializes in cognitive therapies for adult mental disorders, women’s issues, and health psychology.<br />
  Her research includes the integration of mindfulness methods and Future Directed Therapy – a new form of psychotherapy developed by Prof. <br />
Vilhauer for treating depression and other psychological conditions.<br />
  Earlier, she was the director of Cedars Sinai Medical Center’s adult outpatient clinic in Los Angeles and a clinical professor at UCLA. <br />
She has degrees from UCLA and Fordham University and completed her post doc training at Columbia University.  Her recent book — “Think Forward to Thrive: How to Use the Mind’s Power of Anticipation to Transcend Your Past and Transform Your Life” – introduces Future Directed Therapy and how it can be applied to get past fears and anxieties associated with the future.<br />
