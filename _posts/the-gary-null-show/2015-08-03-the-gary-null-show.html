Journalist, investigative reporter Nick Bryant has been writing on the plight of disadvantaged children for over a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
decade. <br />
His writings have appeared in professional publications such as the Journal of Professional Ethics, the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, the Journal of Social Distress and the publication of School Health. <br />
He is the co-author of “America’s Children:  Triumph of Tragedy” that dealt with the mental health problems of lower socioeconomic children.
<br />
He is also the author of  “The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betrayal” that exposes a nationwide pedophile ring that pandered children to a cabal of the rich and powerful and the corruption of the Justice Department and law enforcement to crack down on it – and the co-author of “Confessions of a DC Madam” – co-written with Henry Vinson, who at one time was the head gay pimp for the Washington elite. <br />
His Website is  FranklinScandal.com<br />
