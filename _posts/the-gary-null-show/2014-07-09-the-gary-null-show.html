Chossudovsky is one of world’s leading visionaries in economic trends associated with free market globalization, having identified over 15 years ago many of the problems in global neoliberal economics that are now frequent in our headlines:  austerity, economic shock therapy, the association between rising poverty, the pillaging of developing nations due to the structural adjustment policies of the US led World Bank, IMF and WTO, and the criminalization of our banking system.
