daycare and preschoolers
John Gilmore is the Executive Director of the Autism Action Network, a national, grassroots, non-profit advocacy organization that works on issues that affect the autism community including special education, access to healthcare, vaccine rights, research and services for the disabled. <br />
He is currently engaged in public opposition to a ruling being pushed through the New York City Health Board by Mayor Bloomberg that would mandate the flu and pneumococcal vaccines for all of the city pre-schoolers and daycare children.
<br />
John is also the father of a vaccine-injured 13 year-old son diagnosed with autism. <br />
More information can be found at www.AutismActionNetwork.<br />

Here are the items John says that people can do to stop this proposal:
Come to City hall by noon tomorrow, bring friends, family, and signs.
<br />
Call Mayor-Elect bill de Blasio at (212) 669-7200 and ask him to stop the measure.
<br />
Call Your City Council member and ask them to stop this proposal.
