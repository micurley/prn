Washington
Ralph Nader is one of the most influential Americans of the past several decades.<br />
  He is directly responsible for many of our most important bills that have provided protection to consumers against the onslaughts of corporate short-term profits and the Friedmanite free market, unregulated capitalism. <br />
landmark acts for Freedom of Information, Clean Water, Clean Air, Whistleblower Protection, Wholesome Food, and others that have been enacted by Congress and implemented.<br />
 
A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Ralph has been a presidential candidate for five elections, building his platform on consumer rights, humanitarian and civil rights efforts, environmental sanity, and democratic government.
<br />
Ralph’s most recent book “Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State” that outlines a new progressive path for a sustainable future and to take control back from the Corporate regime in Washington.  His website is Nader.org
