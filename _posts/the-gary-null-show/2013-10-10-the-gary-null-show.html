William Arkin is regarded as one of the nation’s top military experts and specialists in national security issues and intelligence. <br />
He has worked as a military advisor for many nongovernmental organizations and has worked as a columnist for the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.<br />
  In the past William has been associated with the Air Force’s School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, ,and the Air Force research Institute. <br />
He has authored a dozen books, and his most recent is “American Coup: How a Terrified Government is Destroying the Constitution” which is the first book of its kind to investigate a small cadre of unelected “executive agents” who act with complete autonomy to preserve the government at any cost, even if the US government is corrupt and destructive to the fabric of the nation’s constitution.<br />
