Special Series on Fascism: How and why the US can be accurately defined as a police state, with Andrew Kolin 
Professor<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Andrew Kolin is professor of political science at Hilbert College in Hamburg, New York, where he specializes in American political thought, civil liberties, US foreign policy, and constitutional law. <br />
Much of his recent work has focused on the conflicts between state power and democracy and the history of the US turning into a police state.
<br />

His latest book published this year is “State Power and Democracy: Before and During the Presidency of George W Bush” which traces the history of American politics for sowing the seeds for a national police state from the founding of the republic to the present.<br />
