What are the changes of humanity seriously tackling climate change, the dire consequences of our failures to do so, and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
how do we deal with dire predictions of our future, with Dr Guy McPherson. <br />

Dr Guy McPherson is a professor emeritus of Natural Resources, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona. <br />
 He has specialized in forest resources, energy decline and climate change and their economic consequences. <br />
In the past he has also taught at Texas A&amp;M and University of California at Berkeley.
<br />
Having become disillusioned with the American university environment and academia, and after attempts by university officials to silence his outspokenness about the human causes of climate change, Guy abandoned his tenured position as a full professor for ethical reasons of conscience.
<br />
His story is described in a memoir, “Walking Away from Empire” and his website is  GuyMcpherson.com
