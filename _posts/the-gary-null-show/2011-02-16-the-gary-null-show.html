Today’s guest is Matteo Pistono and he is an American Buddhist practitioner, scholar and political activist.
<!--more-->
 For the past decade, Matteo has entered some of the more remote regions of Tibet, evading Chinese security to bring out photos of prisons, secret documents, smuggled interviews of torture victims and acts of human rights abuse. <br />
He has become one of the major sources of such information for the Dalai Lama, non profit organizations, the State Department and various Congressional leaders – all the while keeping his identity concealed.
