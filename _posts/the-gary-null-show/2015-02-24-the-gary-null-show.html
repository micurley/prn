With guest Johann Hari, award winning journalist and investigative reporter, on the failed war on drugs and the need to<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
reevaluate the causes of drug addiction.<br />
 
Johann Hari is an award winning independent journalist and author, and a former investigative reporter for the British newspaper The Independent . <br />
Over the years, Johann has reported from Gaza, the Congo, India, Rwanda, Syria, Venezuela and other countries.<br />
  He has received many awards including Journalist of the Year by Amnesty International for his coverage on the war in the Congo and the Environmental Press Awards for his coverage of Bangladesh. <br />
Confronting his own drug addiction, Johann spent three years investigating the failures in the current war on drugs and the politicizing of drug addiction, including its economic ramifications.  His research resulted in the recent publication of “Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs – which completely overturns and revisions our perceptions about how draconian laws on drug abuse and its causes are no longer valid.  Johann’s website is  ChasingTheScream.com<br />
