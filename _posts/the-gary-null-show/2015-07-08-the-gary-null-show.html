The Greek vote against austerity – NATO/EU/US versus Greece and Russia, with Ray McGovern.
<br />
Ray McGovern served as an Army intelligence officer and a CIA analyst under 7 presidential administration, from the John F. <br />
Kennedy White House to that of George H. <br />
W. <br />
Bush. <br />
Among his duties was preparing the President’s Daily Brief, which was a one-on-one to President Ronald Reagan’s most senior national security advisers.<br />
  He was responsible for the analysis of Soviet intelligence regarding Vietnam and at one time served as the Assistant National Intelligence Officer for Western Europe. <br />
Since retiring from government service, Ray has been a vocal peace activist and journalist and helped create Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) to expose the way intelligence was falsified to “justify” war on Iraq.  Ray’s opinion pieces appear in many leading newspapers here and abroad.<br />
  He holds degrees in theology and philosophy from Fordham University, an MA in Russian History, is a graduate from Harvard Business School and has a certificate of theology from Georgetown University. <br />
