A new look at UFO research .. what is its status..
<!--more-->
what can be confirmed and is the government trying to cover it up or expose it gradually? <br />
With Len Kasten. <br />

Len Kasten has been involved in investigating UFO phenomena since the mid-1960s, when he joined the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, then the country’s most prestigious organization researching UFO reports and exposing them to the press. <br />
 It was after graduating from Cornell and during his service in US Air Force Aviation program that Len had his first UFO encounter. <br />
 Later he was the editor for several early New Age publications including Metamorphosis Magazine and Horizons Magazine and he had participated in the public protests at the Government Accounting Office for the release of the Roswell files. <br />
  Since then he has become leading researcher in UFOology, a frequent contributor to Atlantis Rising magazine, and the current president of the American Philosopher Society. <br />
  He is the author of “The Secret History of Extraterrestrials”  that provides a wonderful overview of many historical encounters with extraterrestrial phenomena and also what the US has gained and learned from ET technology.
