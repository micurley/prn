politics and business for over 25 years for such publications as the New York Times, Discover, Huffington and others. <br />

During the past several years Larry has been conducting in depth research into the 2012 phenomenon – but not just the religious dimensions, , but science, such as contemporary solar physics, astronomical phenomena, and climatic changes.
<br />
His earlier book, “Apocalypse 2012: An Investigation into Civilization’s End” led to the creation of a website Apocalypse2012.<br />
com, which has already received over 20 million hits. <br />
 His most recent book, “Aftermath: A Guide to Preparing for and Surviving Apocalypse 2012” has just been released and explores many of the scientifically founded crises such as solar activity, energy, polar cap melts, climate change and agriculture we are now facing.
