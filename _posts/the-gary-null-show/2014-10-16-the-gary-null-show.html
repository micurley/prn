The latest in health and nutrition, plus up to the minute commentaries, and a special section on Solar Storms<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

including insights from Mat Stein, Lawrence Joseph, and Robert Schoch.<br />
 
Prof. <br />
Robert Schoch (Shock) is a professor of geology at the College of General Studies at Boston University where he has taught since 1984, after receiving his doctorate in geophysicists from Yale University. <br />
Prof Schoch is a leading researcher, scholar and voice in the New Archeology movement, which involves a re-evaluation  of the ancient records of humanity and civilizations based upon more advanced technological analysis of archeological sites and artifacts. <br />
Twenty-five years ago, Robert’s geological research into the Great Sphinx in Egypt, and his analysis of heavy water erosion, resulted in dating the sphinx several 1000 years older than conventional Egyptologists assume.<br />
  Since then he has conducted research on other ancient monuments and early civilizations in Egypt, as well as the vast Goblecki Tepe temple complex in Turkey (dated up to 12,000 years ago), Bosnia, the British Isles, Mexico, Easter Island, and the Yonaguni structures submerged off the coast of Japan to better understand the impact geological and climatic changes had on our ancient ancestors due to astronomical events, such as extreme solar activity. <br />
 He has written many books and research papers, and leads groups to the fascinating sites in Egypt and Turkey.<br />
  His most recent book is “Forgotten Civilization: The Role of Solar Outbursts in Our Past and Future”. <br />
His website is RobertSchoch.com
Lawrence Joseph is a seasoned investigative journalist who has been writing on science, nature, politics and business for over 25 years for such publications as the New York Times, Discover, Huffington and others.<br />
 
During the past several years Larry has been conducting in depth research into the 2012 phenomenon – but not just the religious dimensions, , but science, such as contemporary solar physics, astronomical phenomena, and climatic changes.
<br />
He has written several books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and the impact of solar activity and climate change upon civilization.<br />
  His most recent book is “Solar Cataclysm: How the Sun Shaped the Past and What We Can Do to Save Our Future” —  a continuation of his earlier work dealing with the science behind the potential catastrophes resulting solar activity, energy, polar cap melts, climate change and agriculture.
<br />
Mat Stein is an engineer with a degree in mechanical engineering from MIT and a National Merit Scholar. <br />
He is the owner of Aloha Aina Builders, which specializes in hurricane resistant, energy efficient and environmentally friendly homes, and is also president of Stein Designs which invents consumer and commercial water and bacteriological filtration systems, photovoltaic roofing and other energy efficient and sustainable products.
<br />
Mat writes extensively on sustainable preparedness and self-sufficiency in the face of predictable and unpredictable catastrophic scenarios and conditions.  In addition to writing on the future of perfect storms for the Huffington Post, he is the author of several exhaustive books on how people can prepare themselves for having to rely on our own resources and ingenuity, most notably “ “When Disaster Strikes: A Comprehensive Guide to Emergency Planning and Crisis Survival”   His website is WhenTechFails.com
