Sunday, September 8
1:00 to 3:00 pm
USS Maine Monument, near Columbus Circle in Central Park

Show up wearing as much black as possible, but a black t-shirt and darker jeans is perfect. <br />
Please avoid logos and text on your clothing, as we want this to be visually appealing, and simple.
<br />
Logistics/details:
We expect one volunteer* in white to represent the victims on 9/11/2001. <br />
More volunteers in gray will represent the additional US deaths from the wars, and those who died from health effects, or other aspects of 9/11 and “war on terror”.
<br />
A large group of people dressed in black will represent the people of other nations who have died in the wars, and destruction of entire societies. <br />
Most of these will represent people who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, but other facets of the (pre-planned) “war on terror” will be included. <br />
We will form into various configurations, and take pictures to visually represent the true cost of 9/11.
<br />
If you are sure you will attend, please email us, or use the form below.
