Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal – strategies and dangers
Dr.
<!--more-->
Peter Breggin has been called the “conscience of psychiatry” during his outstanding career to reform the mental health field. <br />
Dr Breggin is a Harvard trained psychiatrist and a former consultant for the National Institutes of Mental Health. <br />
He is one of the harshest critics of current conventional psychotherapeutic approaches in treating mental disorders in both adults and children, particularly the epidemic use of psychoactive drugs. <br />
Along with his wife, he is the founder of the Center for the Study of Empathic Therapy, a non profit organization providing scientific-based information on dangers and adverse effects of psychiatric drugs.
<br />
Dr Breggin has written many important books. <br />
His most recent is “Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal: A Guide for Prescribers, Therapists, Patients and the Families” which gives a comprehensive, lay person review of the strategies, stages and symptoms of drug withdrawal.
