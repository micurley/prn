presidential candidate for the national Justice Party, which he was instrumental in founding. <br />
He is a former two-term mayor of Salt Lake City, having served from 2000 to 2008, and is the executive director for the organization: High Road for Human Rights. <br />
 A former member of the Democratic Party, Rocky left over its evisceration of the Constitution and it having morphed into a poor alternative to the GOP.<br />
  He is highly critical of both the Bush and Obama administrations, and seeks to put the government control over the Federal Reserve, end corporate personhood and the military industrial complex’s stranglehold on Washington. <br />
Prior to entering politics, Rocky practiced law in Utah for 21 years and was listed among the Best Lawyers in America.<br />
  Business Week listed him as one of the top 20 activists on climate change and he has received many awards from various environmental organizations.
