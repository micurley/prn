Sibel Edmonds is a former FBI<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
translator who gained notoriety having exposed illicit activities within the FBI involving security breaches, intelligence neglect about pre-911 communication notifying of a massive attack on American cities, cover-ups and international blocking of intelligence that endangered American security. <br />
Her revealing FBI improprieties resulted in Agency retaliation, termination and eventually attention in the Senate Judiciary Committee
Although Sibel had testified before the 911 commission, her testimony was excluded from the official report.
<br />
She recently published her memoir “Classified Woman-The Sibel Edmonds Story” in March. <br />
She is also the founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition which aids national security whistleblowers and is the publisher of the online independent journalism site Boiling Frogs Post. <br />
Her case was the centerpiece of a 2006 French documentary Kill the Messenger.
