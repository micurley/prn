Bruce Levine, a clinical psychologist in Cincinnati and an activist, author addressing the societal problems in our corporate healthcare system. <br />
 He is regular contributor to Z Magazine, Alternet, Adbusters, the Ecologist and the Huffington Post. <br />

His most recent book, “Get Up Stand Up: Uniting Populists, Energizing the Defeated, and Battling the Corporate Elite” is a thorough investigation into the psychological underpinnings behind the American public’s passivity and aura of powerlessness to stand up against corporate and political powers who are removing the democratic freedoms in the nation.
