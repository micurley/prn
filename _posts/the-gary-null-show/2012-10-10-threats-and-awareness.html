Newsmaker:  Independent study into NY metropolitan’s air quality and its diverse foreign particles
William Bryant Logan<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

is a certified arborist and president of Urban Arborists, Inc.<br />
, a Brooklyn-based tree company. <br />
Logan has won numerous Quill and Trowel Awards from the Garden Writers of America and won a 2012 Senior Scholar Award from the New York State chapter of the International Society of Arborists. <br />

Vaccine Awareness Month, and the progressive political agenda moving into the future

Sallie Elkordy is a progressive activist and citizen lobbyist running for Congress to fill the vacancy in my district, New York’s 9th District in Brooklyn and Queens. <br />
For almost two decades she has been active in establishing a U. <br />
S. <br />
Department of Peace, promoting Anti-trafficking legislation and opposing Vaccine increases and mandates. <br />
The most recent trip I made to Albany, was to advocate against health insurance legislation, written to the detriment of the Autistic people it was supposed to have helped.
<br />
She campaigns to gain support for legislation that promotes U. <br />
S. <br />
military withdrawal from Afghanistan and Libya, and is trying to stop Senate bill #S.<br />
981-The National Defense Authorization Act and is campaigning against both the Food Modernization Act (genetically modified organisms in our food) and against The National Patriot Act (searches without a judge’s warrant, wiretaps, and all without recourse for those targeted).
<br />
She is one of the primary promoters of the Billion Toddlers March for Survival, a worldwide effort to bring awareness of the threats that Thermo-Nuclear War, Vaccines, Chemtrails, GMOs pose to children worldwide.<br />
