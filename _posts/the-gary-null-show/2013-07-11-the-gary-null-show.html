and efforts to derail GMO labeling movement, with David Murphy. <br />

David Murphy is the founder and executive director of Food Democracy Now!<br />
, a grassroots movement of more than 250,000 American farmers and citizens dedicated to reforming our food and agriculture. <br />
He has been called “the most crucial and politically savvy actor in the on-going efforts to help move American agriculture into the 21st century” as a result of his “Sustainable Dozen” campaign, which resulted in four candidates being placed in high level positions at the USDA.
<br />
Previously, he has worked as an environmental and food policy lobbyist and political strategist and is a board member of the Iowa Organic Association.  His website is www.FoodDemocracyNow.org<br />
