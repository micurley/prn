Biocognitive Sciences - how our cultural beliefs and environment contribute to immunity, aging and longevity, wounding<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
and healing, with Dr Mario Martinez. <br />

Dr Mario Martinez is a clinical psychologist specializing in psychoneuroimmunology and anti-aging. <br />
Fifteen years ago, he developed the theory of Biocognitive Science and Psychology, a body-mind theory that explains how thoughts and their biological expression co-emerge within a cultural environment. <br />
He is the founder of the Biocognitive Science Institute in Montevideo, Uruguay, which conducts research and offers training in Biocognition principles.
<br />

Dr Martinez has written numerous articles and research papers, lectures worldwide, and is the author of “The Mind-Body Code; How the Mind Wounds and Heals the Body.<br />
”  Part of his theory emerged from having been a primary science investigator into  the phenomenon of stigmata cases and spontaneous healing for the Catholic Church, BBC and National Geographic. <br />
  His website is www.BioCognitive.com<br />
