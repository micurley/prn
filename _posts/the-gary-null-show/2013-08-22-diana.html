death - with John Morgan.
<br />
 John Morgan is an investigative journalist living near Brisbane Australia. <br />
After being diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy and retiring, he has devoted many years researching and writing about the circumstances surrounding her death in a car accident in 1997. <br />
 He has become the go-to forensic expert in analyzing the British and French records and the Paget investigation report that concluded Diana’s death as an accident. <br />
 In 2009, John received a large volume of unpublished documentation from within the British police Paget investigation, which the court jury never saw, and further revealed a British cover-up to protect the royal family and British military intelligence, suggesting the accident was a planned assassination. <br />
For the past six years, John has published a series of books, under the heading “Diana Inquest” including copious official documentation and transcripts of interviews and legal testimonies. <br />
 Among the series are Cover Up of a Royal Murder, The French Cover-up, The British Cover-up, How and Why Did Princess Diana Die, and Who Killed Princess Diana. <br />
  John’s recent “The Paris-London Connection: The Assassination of Princess Diana” released in 2012 is a condensed version of the entire series.<br />
