Todayâ€™s guest is Dr.
<!--more-->
Gary Greenberg and he is a psychotherapist, author, teacher and a historian of psychiatric diagnosis and illness, now practicing in Connecticut. <br />
He is also a professor at Connecticut College, and his investigative research explores the intersection of science, politics and ethics, and his articles have appeared in Harpers, The New Yorker, Wired, Rolling Stone and Mother Jones. <br />
An earlier article Harpers raised much attention when Gary was treated for depression during a clinical trial. <br />
The caveat was that he was taking the placebo.
