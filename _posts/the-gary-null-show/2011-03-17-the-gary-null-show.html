Today’s guest is Daniel Gardner and he is a senior writer and columnist for the Ottawa Citizen in Canada.
<!--more-->
 During the mid-1990s, he served as a senior policy advisor to the Ministry of Education in Ontario. <br />
 As a journalist, Dan has received numerous Canadian and international awards including two Amnesty International Media Awards for his investigations into torture and Russian dissidents.
<br />
We had Dan on our program a couple years ago, speaking on the science behind fear. <br />
 His new focus has been on the tradition of making predictions, in his new book “Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions are Next to Worthless and You Can Do Better.”
