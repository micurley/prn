journalist for many years with the Forth Worth Star Telegraph and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex before embarking a path of independency to research, investigate and write on many events involving cover-up operations. <br />
His earlier book on the JFK conspiracy, entitled Crossfire, was the basis for Oliver Stone’s film JFK.  His books “Rule by Secrecy” and “The Rise of the Fourth Reich” were New York Times best sellers.  His most recent book is “Population Control: How Corporate Owners are Killing Us” which reviews the many ways that corporate and government are lessening the length and quality of life through the means of a police state for the benefit of oligarchs.  <br />
