John Michael Greer is one of America’s most insightful historical philosophers, a futurist and independent scholar,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
environmentalist, expert in energy and peak oil studies, and a novelist. <br />
He is also the Archdruid of the Ancient Order of Druids in America. <br />
His analysis of the rise and fall of civilizations and the limits of technology and the idea of progress have been recommended by numerous peer-reviewed journals and magazines. <br />
The Futurist magazine has called his portrayal of the rise and collapse of civilization as one of the more realistic analysis one can find.  John is regarded as one of the most influential figures in the peak oil community.  His blog, the Archdruid Report, is widely read for his commentaries on nature, spirituality, sustainable culture, and critiques of postmodern industrial civilization.  He has published over 20 books.  His most recent is “After Progress; Reason and Religion at the End of the Industrial Age,”  and his website isTheArchDruidReport.blogspot.com
