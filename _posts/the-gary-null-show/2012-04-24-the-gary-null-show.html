<!--more-->
director of Internet Communications for Howard Dean’s groundbreaking 2003–2004 presidential campaign. <br />
Highly regarded as a new media strategist, Mat has consulted for numerous political campaigns, advocacy organizations, and global non-governmental organizations. <br />
He has profiled in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe, and Fast Company.
<br />
Mat is the co-author with his wife Mel Gilles of a recent book that has sparked appraise from some of our more important environmental advocates such as Derrick Jensen and Bill McKibben. <br />
The book is “The Last Myth: What the Rise of Apocalyptic Thinking Tells Us About America” – which explores how such beliefs, both religious and secular have come to dominate the politics, economics and culture of America and prevent us from clearly taking the appropriate action towards real, objective challenges and threats such as climate change, peak oil and the disintegration of a cohesive society.
