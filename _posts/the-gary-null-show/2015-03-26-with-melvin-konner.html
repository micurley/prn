superiority?

Prof. <br />
Melvin Konner is the Samuel Chandler Dobbs Professor of Anthropology and Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia.  He received his doctorate in biological anthropology from Harvard, having done field work with the Kalahari Bushmen in Africa and later received an MD from Harvard Medical School.<br />
  He is the author of 8 books and many peer-reviewed papers, his latest is a particularly controversial yet provocative and important work: “Women After All: Sex, Evolution and the End of Male Supremacy” – which questions our cultural assumptions of maleness and the superior status it has been afforded by our male-dominant society and advocates for the raising of women’s status to bring sanity to our world. <br />
