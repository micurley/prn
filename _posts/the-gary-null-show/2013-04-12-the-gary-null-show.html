A conversation with Andrew Wakefield — the MMR vaccine and medical denialism of government health authorities and the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

science-based community
Dr Andrew Wakefield (Andy) is an gastroenterologist and academician specializing in inflammatory bowel disease and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or MMR. <br />
He is a former Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and has published over 130 original scientific papers and book chapters. <br />
In 1998, he and his colleagues at the Royal Free Hospital in London reported a novel inflammatory bowel disease in children with developmental disorders such as autism. <br />
 Dr Wakefield resisted pressure to stop his investigations into a possible link between vaccinations, intestinal inflammation and autism. <br />
In 2001 he was awarded the fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists and he has been a board member of the American charity Medical Interventions for Autism.
<br />
Dr Wakefield’s book “Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines, The Truth Behind the Tragedy” published by Skyhorse Press recounts his research into autism, the MMR vaccine and GI illnesses and his legal struggles by government and medical health authorities to discredit him and his work.
