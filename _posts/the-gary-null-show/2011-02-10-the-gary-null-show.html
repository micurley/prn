Today’s guest is Brent Leung and he is a young Canadian born film director, with a degree in psychology from Kwantlen<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
University in British Columbia and the Watkins Film School in Nashville. <br />
 Brent’s first documentary, House of Numbers, is the latest controversial film to challenge the official HIV-AIDS story. <br />
 Having been troubled by the media’s portrayal of AIDS, Brent embarked on a journey to many countries to film and interview major players on both sides of the HIV debate. <br />
House of Numbers won international media attention and awards. <br />
 One of the primary reasons for the film being a victim of a concerted effort by the AIDS establishment is because Brent managed to get access to interview and film some of the primary guardians of the HIV-AIDS story – including Luc Montagnier, Robert Gallo, John Levy, Anthony Fauci, Jim Moore and others, and present their own words showing that HIV is barely understood by the so-called experts and authorities and the research establishment is in disarray and our health policy dealing with AIDS is a disaster.
<br />
Brent is preparing a new release of approximately 10 hours of footage focusing on his interviews with the leaders of the AIDS-HIV story. <br />
