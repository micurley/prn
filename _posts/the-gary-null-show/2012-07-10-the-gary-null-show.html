Why do vaccines fail to give us lasting immunity to viral diseases?
<!--more-->

Why do vaccines provide no guarantee of protection from invasive bacterial diseases? <br />

Why does vaccination destroy herd immunity and eliminate our chance to prevent diseases naturally?
<br />

These questions and more will be addressed by my guest, Dr Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her PhD in immunology from the Rockefeller University, New York, NY and has done postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. <br />
After a few years of career break devoted to birthing and caring for her young child, she resumed her postdoctoral research at Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA. <br />
She is an educator on natural immunity and vaccines in her local birth community. <br />
