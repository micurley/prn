Today’s guest is Dr.
<!--more-->
Joseph Debe and he is a Chiropracter and Board certified nutritionist in New York State who has specialized in sports injuries and physical fitness. <br />
He is Director of Clinical Nutrition for DREAM Wellness health centers. <br />
He has written numerous articles on natural health and wellness and is author of the book The Ultimate Creatine Handbook:  A Safe Alternative for Healthy Muscle Building.
<br />
One area of Dr Debay’s specialty is Functional Medicine laboratory tests – such as nutrients status, toxins, hormone levels, food allergies, sugar metabolism and others — for uncovering underlying causes for diseases.
<br />
Many of the most important laboratory tests that benefit alternative medical physicians and holistic practitioners are not permitted in New York – including hair analysis for measuring nutrient and toxic chemical levels. <br />
 It is quite shocking to hear the list of tests New York does not permit. <br />
 Dr Debay has been spearheading an effort to change this and have them approved.
