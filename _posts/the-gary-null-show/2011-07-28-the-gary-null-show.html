Today’s guest is Debbie Coffey
Debbie Coffey is a citizen journalist for Marti Oakley’s PPJ Gazette.
<!--more-->
 She has reported on foreign-owned mining companies that buy ranches for the water rights, the mining of aquifers, federally controlled public lands that sell and/or lease land at $2 an acre to oil and gas companies and other public land issues. <br />
Debbie has also researched and reported on other abuses by federal agencies, particularly the Department of Interior and the USDA. <br />
The trail leads to the implementation of international UN laws by US federal agencies that violate the Constitution and bypass Congress.
<br />
Over the years Debbie has travelled the Western states to witness the Bureau of Land Management using helicopters to round up our wild horses to the brink of extinction (off of their federally protected areas on public lands). <br />
 She is currently on the Board of Directors of Wild Horse Education  (www.wildhorseeducation.<br />
org).
