How the US government uses corporations and universities  to support government policies, silence top scientists and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

researchers that jeopardize our health and protect the corporate state
Dr David Lewis is a former senior research microbiologist with the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Research and Development department and the only EPA scientist to be a lead author on research published in Nature, the Lancet and Nature Medicine. <br />
He was responsible for discovering that HIV could be transmitted through certain dental equipment, which led to the standardization of heat-sterilization in dentistry. <br />
His research also forced the EPA to abandon the policy of promoting sewage sludge on farms, which subsequently forced him to lose his job when he turned his attention to studying illnesses and deaths associated with this practice – including biosolids link to autism.<br />
  Dr Lewis has received many awards and is currently the Senior Science Advisor to the national Whistleblowers Center. <br />
He has also reviewed the research of Dr Wakefield, which was provided to him personally by Andy, and has his own case going with Brian Deer.
<br />
He is the author of a recently published book:  “Science for Sale” which details how the US government uses powerful corporations and leading universities to support policies, silence top scientists, jeopardize public health and protect corporate profits.
