Derrick Jensen has become one of the nation’s leading voices of cultural and environmental dissent, who writes on how<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
civilization is devastating the environment and the natural world, and our society’s denial of that fact. <br />
Utne Reader listed Derrick among the 50 visionaries changing the world. <br />
In sharp contrast to environmental optimists who believe working within the corporate system will offset the tenuous planetary balance threatened by climate change, Derrick has advocated for many years a “dismantling of civilization” which can include radical dissent as well as imparting wisdom to our children. 
Derrick has written many books, his most recent being “The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution”  and “Earth At Risk: Building a Resistance Movement to Save the Planet.”  He also hosts a weekly radio program, Resistance Radio, on the Progressive Radio Network every Sunday evening at 6:00 pm Eastern time.   His website is  www.DerrickJensen.org<br />
