How the global economic cabal, military industrial cartel and our failure to address climate change are creating a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

perfect storm leading to a tyrannical world order
Our guest today is the Honorable Paul Hellyer.<br />
  Mr Hellyer is the former Canadian Liberal party politician who held the position of Minister of National Defense, the Canadian equivalent for our Secretary of Defense in the 1960s. <br />
He started his political career in 1949 and in 1969 he was designated as Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister. <br />
He has been the longest serving member of the Privy Council just ahead of Prince Philip.<br />
  Later he sat in Canadian Parliament as an independent and formed the Canadian Action Party in the mid 1990s seeking monetary reform and oppose Canada’s rapid globalization policies. <br />
Throughout his life Paul has been opposed to the weaponization of space and during the past decade has become an ardent spokesperson calling upon governments to disclose their knowledge and research into recovered alien technology. <br />
He participated in the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure, chaired by six former US Congressmen, to testify on extraterrestrial presence. <br />
In addition to Mr Hellyer’s political activities, he is also an author and commentator who has written over a dozen books dealing with macroeconomics, financial crises, globalization, climate change and extraterrestrial technology. <br />
His most recent book is “The Money Mafia: A World in Crisis”. <br />
