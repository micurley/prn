climates, and climate change’s affect on health, with Guy McPherson
Dr Guy McPherson is a professor emeritus of Natural Resources, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.<br />
  He has specialized in forest resources, energy decline and climate change and their economic consequences. <br />
In the past he has also taught at Texas A&amp;M and University of California at Berkeley.
<br />
Having become disillusioned with the American university environment and academia, and after attempts by university officials to silence his outspokenness about the human causes of climate change, Guy abandoned his tenured position as a full professor for ethical reasons of conscience. <br />
He is the author of several books, the latest co-written with Carolyn Baker entitled “Extinction Dialogs: How to Live with Death in Mind.”  He is also the co-host of the radio program Nature Bats Last heard every Tuesday evening at 8 pm Eastern on the Progressive Commentary Hour.  His website is  GuyMcpherson.com<br />
