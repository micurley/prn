Prof. <br />
Henry Pollack and his colleagues on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former vice president Al Gore.<br />
  Prof. <br />
Pollack is a professor emeritus of geophysics at the University of Michigan where he has taught for over forty years, travels regularly to Antarctica, and has conducted scientific research on all seven continents. <br />
He now serves as a science adviser to Al Gore’s Climate Project. <br />
He is the author of “Uncertain Science , Uncertain World”, and his most recent book is “A World Without Ice” which explores how for the first time in human history, the delicate relationship between human growth, rising industrial economies and what remaining ice there is in the world is at a dangerous precipice.
