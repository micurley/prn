Has Cannabis become TOO HIGH TO FAIL?
<!--more-->
 Doug Fine’s best-selling reportage on the legalization of pot in the northern California county of Mendocino gives us a serious look at the future of America’s drug policy. <br />
 Fine gives us lively, committed and often very funny tales of the $6 BILLION (that’s not a typo) business that legal marijuana has become in the legendary “Emerald Triangle.<br />
”   It’s a a lively, enlightened Green Power &amp; Wellness Show, if you can remember it. <br />
 If not, listen to to how the  Solartopia of post-prohibition pot is coming soon. <br />
 And have a ton of fun coming with us! <br />
