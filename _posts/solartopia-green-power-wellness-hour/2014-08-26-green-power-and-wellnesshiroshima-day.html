HIROSHIMA DAY in Berkeley allowed me the opportunity speak at the Unitarian Meeting House for the August 6, 2014<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

commemoration of the terrible bombing and ensuing destruction, which is now being matched and more at FUKUSHIMA. <br />
 I had the honor and privilege of addressing a room full of fabulous citizen/activists about the burning issues of NUCLEAR POWER, ATOMIC WEAPONS AND OUR SOLARTOPIAN FUTURE on this sacred evening. <br />
 The talk was beautifully recorded by Maria Gilardin of WTUC radio, for which we deeply thank her. <br />
 We also thank the organizers of this evening, including Phoebe Sorgen, Cynthia Papermaster, Cecile Pineda and so many more. <br />
 Cecile, who is author of THE DEVIL’S TANGO, was kind enough to do the introductions. <br />
 We hope you find this hour-long presentation challenging and inspiring.
