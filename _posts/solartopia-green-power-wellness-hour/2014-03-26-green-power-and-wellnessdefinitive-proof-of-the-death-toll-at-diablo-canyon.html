DEFINITIVE PROOF OF THE DEATH TOLL AT DIABLO CANYON comes to us from two great experts. <br />
 DR. <br />
JERRY BROWN of the World Business Academy and JOE MANGANO, MPH, report of their just-released study showing a clear rise in the death rate around California’s 2 remaining atomic reactors at San Luis Obispo. <br />
 
Joe also discusses definitive health studies showing the death toll at Three Mile Island and tells us what to expect when sea-borne radiation arrives on the beaches of California. <br />
 Mangano’s studies were the first to show the impacts in the United States from the radiation that came here by air just five days after the explosions and Fukushima, and he warns that worse is yet to com. <br />
 
If you are at all concerned about the on-going dangers of radiation from atomic reactors near and far, this powerful interview lays the foundation for a scientific basis for global concern. <br />
