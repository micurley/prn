HELEN CALDICOTT joins us for a thorough excursion into the insane, life-threatening world of atomic energy.<br />
Since 1971 Helen has been leading the charge to rid the planet of the nuclear power and weapons technologies that threaten all life on Earth. <br />
 She has studied the impacts of the accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima and has thoroughly documented the biological destruction the atomic power industry continues to do to us all.Helen also experienced the ultimate hair-rising White House meeting with Ronald Reagan, then in the early stages of Alzheimer’s, to discuss the future of nuclear weapons—an epic moment that has impacted us all.<br />
Her new book, CRISIS WITHOUT END (New Press), documents her recent conference on nuclear health impacts just as she is organizing yet another top-level conference on nuclear weaponry, to take place in February. <br />
 Hear all about it at this immensely important excursion in the necessary world of a nuke-free Solartopia….
