OIL DISASTER IN SANTA BARBARA!!!
EARTHQUAKE &amp; MELT-DOWN AT DIABLO NEXT?
We talk with BECCA CLAUSSEN and DR.
<!--more-->
JERRY BROWN of the World Business Academy in Santa Barbara about the latest catastrophe from King CONG (Coal, Oil, Nukes, Gas) as tens of thousands of gallons of oil spill onto pristine California beaches.
<br />
For years the region’s citizens fought off shore drilling there. <br />
 Now, exactly what they predicted has happened—a pipeline company has spewed its crude all over the beaches and into the ocean, killing marine life and harming our planet with still more poisons.
<br />
Meanwhile, the company’s owners go scott-free.
<br />
At the same time new revelations about earthquake faults surrounding Diablo Canyon have upped the ante on those shaky reactors’ license. <br />
 Amidst chaos and death, we grow ever closer to shutting that horrific power plant.
<br />
Listen how from these two great activists, as we struggle to save the eco-systems without which we cannot survive. <br />
