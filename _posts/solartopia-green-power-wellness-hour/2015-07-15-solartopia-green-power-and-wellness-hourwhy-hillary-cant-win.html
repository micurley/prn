in the US and to explain why Hillary cannot get elected in 2016.
<br />
The reason is simple: the electronic voting machines are rigged.
<br />
This first of two shows outlines the rise of electronic voting and its intimate links to the Bush family, dating back to the 1988 election which Bush One stole first from Bob Dole, then from Mike Dukakis.
<br />
We track the progress of electronic voting machines through the thefts of 2000 and 2004.

If you believe in democracy and your blood doesn’t boil while listening to this, check your pulse.<br />
