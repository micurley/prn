A NUKE-FREE SOUTH PACIFIC and the END TO ATOMIC POWER in California and elsewhere is the domain of JIM HEDDLE and MARY<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
BETH BRANGAN of the Ecological Options Network of Bolinas, California (www.eon3.<br />
net).
<br />
Mary Beth and Jim tell us first of their award-winning documentary on the resistance of the people of Palau against the incursion of the US nuclear military into their South Sea paradise. <br />
 For their troubles, EON was blacklisted by the Reagan Administration but has persevered over the years and is now at the forefront of documenting the fight to end atomic energy in California and make it a Solartopian reality.
<br />
EON continues to document the fight to deal with the radioactive waste from the thankfully shut San Onofre reactors, and to force Diablo to obey the law on issues of water quality, seismic safety and fire protection (www.nonukesca.net)
With their brilliant insights and rich history, Jim and Mary Beth’s EON operation both documents and makes history (eon3emf.<br />
net), and we’re honored to hear them tell us how. <br />
