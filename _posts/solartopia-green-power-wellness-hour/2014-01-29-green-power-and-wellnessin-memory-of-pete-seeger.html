title: Green Power And WellnessIn Memory of Pete Seeger
---
 We honor the magnificent PETE SEEGER on a show that opens with his SOLARTOPIA SONG.
<!--more-->
 Pete has left us at age 94 (TOSHI departed last year at 91) and we remember them with Solartopia Writer/Singer David Bernz, along with Steve Kent and Susan Shapiro from his stomping grounds in upstate New York, and Greta Johnston, his No Nukes fan in Alabama. <br />
 Pete’s astonishing musical genius and this wonderful couple’s enormous heart can never be replaced, but we can enjoy GUANTANAMERA and TURN, TURN, TURN while we remember their  work on the Clearwater, at Seabrook and Indian Point, and so much. <br />
 So long, Seegers. <br />
 You are with us forever. <br />
 <br />
