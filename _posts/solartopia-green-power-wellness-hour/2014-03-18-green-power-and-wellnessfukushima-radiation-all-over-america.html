FUKUSHIMA RADIATION ALL OVER AMERICA is the grim reality we now face.
<!--more-->
 We hear from MICHAEL COLLINS whose www.enviroreporter.<br />
com in southern California has done the breakthrough reporting on the detection of radioactive fallout from Fukushima. <br />
 Collins tells us that Geiger Counter readings from the California coast to Death Valley to Texas, Florida and elsewhere are showing huge spikes in radiation that can only be coming from Japan. <br />
 The implications for the health of all living things are horrifying, but this is the post-Apocalyptic planet we now occupy.
<br />
To open the show we get a roundup from NICK THABIT at http://fukushimathirdanniversaryevents.blogspot.<br />
com on the dozens of protests, gatherings, rallies, etc that happened around the world tocommemorate the beginning of the Fukushima disaster.
