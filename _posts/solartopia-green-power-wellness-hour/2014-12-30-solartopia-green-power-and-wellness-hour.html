SOLAR POWER coming to the world with FEED-IN TARIFFS as explained by the great wind and solar pioneer PAUL GIPE.Talking<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
to us from Bakersfield, Paul’s incredible depth of experience and knowledge lights up the Solartopia show as he begins with harrowing tales of the early days of the rough-and-tumble wind business.<br />
Then he explains the power and importance of the feed-in tariff to the amazingly successful transition of Germany into the Solartopian Age. <br />
 Germany now gets fully 25% of its electricity from green sources and could be getting even more were it not for the resistance of desperate utility companies trying to protect their obsolete industry.Paul further explains how California and other American states could easily and profitably get to 100% renewables…complete with community ownership.<br />
If you are at all interested in the survival of our planet, don’t miss this substance-filled, goal-oriented dialogue with one of the great geniuses of the Solartopian Age. <br />
