SAFE ENERGY IN THE SOUTHEAST as the Solartopia Show is honored by long-time activists TOM CLEMENTS and SARA BARZCAK.
<!--more-->
 These Solartopiam stalwarts fill us in on the battles over federal loan guarantees for the overpriced, untested and uninsurable AP-1000 reactors being built in Georgia on your taxpayer dollars, and the two more being rammed down the throats of South Carolina ratepayers. <br />
 These “vanguard” new nukes are the last vile hope of an industry headed rapidly down the tubes, along with the equally unproved “small modular reactors” which don’t really exist but seem to sound good to that caterpillar on the mushroom.<br />
We are initially joined by NICK THABIT who fills us in on the exciting new demonstrations being planned for the March 11 anniversary of the start of the Fukushima disaster. <br />
 See you in Solartopia!
