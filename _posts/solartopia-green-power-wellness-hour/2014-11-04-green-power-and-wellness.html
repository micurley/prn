The horrible curse of MIGRAINE HEADACHES is the subject of a brilliant cinematic work-in-progress from SUSANNA STYRON<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
and JACKIE OCHS. <br />
 The award-winning director/producer team explores for us the complex, politically-charged world of a neurological disorder that is imperfectly understood and severely challenging for all who encounter it.<br />
Their film, OUT OF MY HEAD, is working its way through Kickstarter, where clips can be seen and a fuller understanding can be reached. <br />
 Jackie and Susanna’s previous film, 9/12, about some of the interpersonal aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centers, attracted a powerful audience and won numerous awards. <br />
 Count on OUT OF MY HEAD to do the same, and don’t miss this riveting Solartopian dialog.<br />
In our second half-hour my long-time co-conspirator BOB FITRAKIS enlightens us on some ugly realities defining yet another bought-rigged-stolen-lynched election. <br />
 The corporate GOP has conspired to set the narrative of a Republican victory, and then to make it happen by disenfranchising millions of suspected Democrats while rigging voting machines and blacking out polling places…and that’s the least of it. <br />
 Brace yourself for the worst as we get to the bottom of how the corporations are killing our democracy. <br />
