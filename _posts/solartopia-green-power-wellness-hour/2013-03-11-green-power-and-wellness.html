In the shadow of Fukushima, join activist/organizer Deb Katz, filmmaker Dan Keller and NO NUKES author Anna Gyorgy with<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
HarveyW as we cover energy from No Nukes to Germany’s shift to Solartopia. <br />
 Deb gives us the field report on the campaign to shut Vermont Yankee and other northeastern reactors. <br />
 Dan tells us about his “conspiratorial” role in the legendary toppling of the infamous Montague weather tower in 1974 that, in part through his award-winning films, helped birth the global No Nukes movement. <br />
 And Anna fills us in on the actual birth of Solartopia in Germany, the world’s 4th-largest economy, where nukes are being buried as fast as possible by cheaper, safer, cleaner and more welcome green power. <br />
 As much as it’s possible to be up-beat on the 2d anniversary of the catastrophe at Fukushima, this show certainly is.
