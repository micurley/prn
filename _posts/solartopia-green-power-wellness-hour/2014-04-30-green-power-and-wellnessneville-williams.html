SOLAR POWER is now a $100 billion industry, and NEVILLE WILLIAMS has been present at the creation.
<!--more-->
 His new SUN POWER tells the riveting story of his evolution from a Vietnam War correspondent to a solar entrepreneur who helped start two very successful green companies. <br />
 One of those companies has fit more than 100,000 homes in India with panels that give them their light. <br />
 Another has done tens of millions of dollars worth of installations throughout our nation’s capital.<br />
Neville’s personal acquaintance with the great Arthur C. <br />
Clarke and his decades of amazingly effective work in the solar business make for great radio listening—and for some real guidelines on how to plunge into an industry whose Childhood’s End is very much at hand….<br />
with trillions of dollars about to be made while saving the Earth for generations to come. <br />
