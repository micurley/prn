SHUTTING DIABLO CANYON will be the focus of a major conference in San Luis Obispo this coming weekend.
<!--more-->
 We’re joined by LINDA SEELEY, JIM HEDDLE &amp; MARY BETH BRANGAN who are at its core to talk about how we finally close two reactors that could irradiate the entire nation.The conference details are posted at NonukesCA.<br />
net. <br />
 We discuss in this radio session the key issues of earthquake vulnerability, economic obsolescence, the need for cooling towers and much much more, leading up to what we hope will be a successful grass roots campaign that will rid our Earth once and for all of these dangerous and deteriorating reactors.<br />
Join us on the radio to get briefed, and then in the campaign in California or wherever else your nearest nuke might be. <br />
 The clock is ticking on all these reactors and the time to shut them is now.<br />
