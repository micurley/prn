We go from UNPLUG NUCLEAR POWER to OCCUPY and the DANDELION INSURRECTION!
<!--more-->

For Fukushima Day, activist JOE DE MARE of Bowling Green, Ohio, lays out the terms of the annual 3/11 power down to commemorate the horrific disaster that still pollutes our precious Pacific (http://www.toledofreepress.<br />
com/tag/nuclear-energy/ ). <br />
 Joe tells us how every year a multi-stage UNPLUG boycott of electric use emphasizes public opposition to corporate control of our energy supply. <br />
 He explains that while the Bowling Green utility owns 6 of its own windmills, it’s also signed on to a devastating power purchase contract with a coal-burning utility that is undermining the community’s economy.
<br />

From RIVERA SUN we hear about solar energy and utility issues in the New Mexico town of Taos, where she and her partner live in a solar-heated home. <br />
 Rivera is an OCCUPY ACTIVIST ( http://www.riverasun.<br />
com ) and radio host who’s written and community/self published three novels including BILLIONAIRE BUDDHIST and THE DANDELION INSURRECTION. <br />
 With a beautiful voice and a gentle soul, Rivera tells us of her excursions into non-violence and of what too much money can do to people. <br />
