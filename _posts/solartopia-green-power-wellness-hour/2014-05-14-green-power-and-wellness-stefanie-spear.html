the latest breaking news and features on all things environmental.<br />
Stef talks with us about sustainability and her recent trip to Denmark’s Samso Island, where a community of some 3800 people is making the successful transition to total energy self-sufficiency. <br />
  With 21 windmills the community already generates more electricity than it uses, and is on schedule to completely convert all its consumption away from any trace of fossil/nukes. <br />
 Stef also tells us about the Oberlin Project, which is converting this northern Ohio college town to a totally green economy, including a large green art district. <br />
 As one of the world’s leading eco-writer/editors, this hour just flies by with its sustainable, fact-based pathways to a real and true Solartopian future. <br />
