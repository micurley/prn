DON’T FRACK/NUKE OUR EARTH!!!
<!--more-->
Our Solartopian airwaves light up with DAVID BRAUN and LINDA SEELEY, long-time veterans of the No Nukes and Anti-Fracking movements.David has helped organize the successful campaign that’s banned fracking in New York while Linda has worked with the Mothers for Peace of San Luis Obispo that’s helped rid California of all its nuke power reactors with just the two at Diablo Canyon lingering on, now under increasingly powerful grassroots attack.Together they explore the spirit and politics of WINNING an EARTH that is FREE OF FOSSIL/NUKE DESTRUCTION, a Solartopia where our children and theirs can survive and thrive.<br />
And together we proclaim an upcoming conference, and the joys of a combined movement powerful enough to get us to Solartopia. <br />
 Don’t miss this beautiful, inspiring green-powered ode to our Mother Earth!. <br />
