For the third and final show of this series we’re again joined by world-renown election protection expert BOB FITRAKIS<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
to discuss what we can expect in the presidential and other elections of 2016.
<br />
The answer is clear:  we can expect the unexpected.
<br />
In particular, given the fact that the nation’s electronic voting machines—and thus the ultimate vote count—are in the hands of the GOP, HILLARY CLINTON would need a VERY substantial majority to be able to claim the White House.
<br />
The only visible way that could happen at this point would be for DONALD TRUMP to run as a third party candidate, siphoning off votes from the Republicans as did ROSS PEROT in 1992. <br />
 That was how BILL CLINTON got into the White House then, and it may be Hillary’s only chance now.
<br />
We also talk about how Ohio Governor JOHN KASICH illegitimately won election in 2010, and how the GOP stole the US Senate in 2014.
<br />
This will all be part of Bob &amp; Harvey’s upcoming WHY HILLARY CAN’T WIN. <br />
 Listen now, see it soon!!!
