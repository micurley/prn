These are the world’s leading researchers on the health impacts from atomic radiation as manifested around commercial reactors. <br />
 Their peer-reviewed studies show definitively that when nuclear reactors shut, the health of the downwind human population improves. <br />
 That radiation from FUKUSHIMA has impacted human beings throughout the United States. <br />
 That CHERNOBYL has killed at least a million people around the world. <br />
 And that the commercial reactors don’t need to melt down and explode to destroy the health of the people living near by.
<br />
Next time someone tells you atomic energy is safe, send them to listen to Joe and Janette for this definitive hour deep in the heart of Solartopia….
