 The powerful new book from our guest MARK SCHAPIRO lays out the true costs of a fossil-based economy and what it’s<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
doing to our global economy, health and eco-sphere.<br />
Mark is a long-time veteran of the contentious issues surrounding fossil fuels. <br />
 His unique range of expertise and insight gives him a powerful perspective on what we really confront when we turn that ignition switch or fire up that gas heater. <br />
 So Mark explains in frightening detail what FRACKING is doing to the Earth and reminds us that those cold, powerful bean-counters at carbon corporate HQ do take the size and political impact of our marches into account.<br />
Speaking to us from Oakland, California, Mark brings decades of deep insight to an industry that affects us all, where price simply doesn’t match cost, and where we need to transition really fast to renewable energy if we’re going to survive on this planet. <br />
