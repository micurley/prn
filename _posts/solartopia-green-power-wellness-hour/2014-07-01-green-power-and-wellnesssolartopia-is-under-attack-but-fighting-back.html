renewables and efficiency. <br />
As JEN MILLER, director of the Ohio Sierra Club tells us, the corporate billionaires from ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council) have swung Ohio into anti-Solartopia attack mode. <br />
 This is happening all over the country, and Ohio is now the cutting edge of a huge push-back from King CONG (Coal, Oil, Nukes &amp; Gas). <br />

Meantime, in America’s test market—Columbus—CAROLYN HARDING is helping with a COMMUNITY BILL OF RIGHTS designed to allow human beings to control FRACKING and protect themselves from total environmental destruction. <br />
 Crafted by the COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND, this list of limitations on tracking is headed for the Columbus ballot. <br />
Carolyn tells how you and your own community can make this happen nationwide—to save our children and our planet. <br />
