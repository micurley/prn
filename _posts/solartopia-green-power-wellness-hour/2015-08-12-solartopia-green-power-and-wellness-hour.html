TOWARD A NON-NUCLEAR NEW ENGLAND!
<!--more-->

To hear about SHUTTING NUKE POWER especially in New England we are joined by three great activists: Â SHEILA PARKS, DIANE TURCO and DEB KATZ.
<br />

All three have been fighting for years to close some of the worldâ€™s worst reactors.
<br />

Deb is a founder of the CITIZENSâ€™ AWARENESS NETWORK which has been at the core of the successful movement to shut Vermont Yankee. <br />
Â As she points out, New England activists have won major victories not only at VY, but at Maine Yankee, Connecticut Yankee, Yankee Rowe, Seabrook 2, Millstone 1 and more.
<br />

Diane is hard at work shutting the Pilgrim reactor, south of Boston, where devastating health issues have arisen. <br />
Â Boston-based public health researcher RICHARD CLAPP was among the first to prove a clear connection between reactor radiation releases and rising cancer rates.
<br />

Sheila has continued to work on the moral and ethical questions around nuclear power, the TPP and healthy food. <br />
Â Her work in the Boston area includes organizing a speech in Waltham Friday, August 14 (Â http://tinyurl.<br />

. <br />
Â See you thereâ€Śand in a Solartopia New England!<br />
