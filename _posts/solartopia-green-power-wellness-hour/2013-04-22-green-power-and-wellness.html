WE GET TO SOLARTOPIA BY SHUTTING SAN ONOFRE as we begin with nuclear opponents Donna Gilmore and Michael Mariotte.
<!--more-->
 From southern California Donna tells us about the local battle to keep Units 2 &amp; 3 permanently shut. <br />
 Michael speaks from the Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service about how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs to be forced to stop giving out licenses to reactors that threaten us all.
<br />
Then PAUL GIPE re-joins us to further explain the nuts and bolts of how Solartopian technology is re-shaping our world’s energy system. <br />
 A true godfather of the renewable energy industry, Paul’s iron grip on the nitty-gritties of the green transformation in Germany and elsewhere makes for an irreplaceable primer on how we must power a truly sustainable future. <br />
