FUKUSHIMA IS STILL HAPPENING as we hear from PAUL GUNTER and KEVIN KAMPS of BEYOND NUCLEAR about the horrific on-going<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
disaster in Japan. <br />
 Far from being calmed and cool, the crisis in spent fuel management continues at Fukushima. <br />
 Loss of coolant in Unit Five’s spent fuel pool has developed. <br />
 Units Four, Three, Two and One are also in varying states of flux, to the extent that Tokyo Electric has taken a “vacation” from bring down damaged fuel rods at Unit Four. <br />
 Paul also reports that a two-inch piece of spent plutonium fuel has been found more than a mile away from the reactors, along with many other fragments of what was obviously a fission explosion. <br />
 That the assault on nuclear regulators in Japan continues. <br />
 And that the Japanese people have stood firm against opening any of the 48 other reactors still shut. <br />
 NONE of this is being reported in ANY corporate media despite its life-and-death impacts on us all. <br />
 Paul and Kevin will be back with us for more reports. <br />
 In the meantime, please listen closely and send the links for this important show so others can know that FUKUSHIMA IS NOT OVER!!!
