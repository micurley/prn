ATOMIC TERRORISM, the KEYSTONE PIPELINE and the WAR AGAINST RENEWABLES power up our Solartopia Green Power &amp;<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Wellness Show. <br />
 Our great guest STEFANIE SPEAR fills us in on the latest developments in the March to Solartopia as documented in her superb and invaluable ECOWATCH.COM website.<br />
Stefanie is the creator, producer and editor of this uniquely important internet outlet for news of the environment. <br />
 Based in Cleveland, we talk about my current article on Charlie Hebdot and nuclear terrorism.<br />
Stef then fills us in on the upcoming veto of the Keystone XL pipeline and the prospects for stopping it. <br />
 And she follows with a report on the march of renewable energy in Denmark, Britain, Germany, Scotland and Ireland, as northern Europe marches ever more quickly into Solartopia.<br />
But we conclude with the need for a national energy policy here. <br />
 California is leading the way in the US. <br />
 But the Koch Brothers and other mega-billionaires invested in fossil and nuclear fuels are doing their best to stop the solar revolution. <br />
 How we overcome and the last word from Stefanie this time around. <br />
 But she will be back, &amp; we will win!
<br />
