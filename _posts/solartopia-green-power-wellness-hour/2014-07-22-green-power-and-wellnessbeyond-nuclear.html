vulnerable our atomic reactors really are.  From tissue-paper “containment” domes to terrorist targetings, vulnerable spent fuel pools, danger from “inland tsunamis” caused by dam breaks, exposed water pumps, unprotected control rooms and much more, we hear just some of the bad news about how a really dangerous world is made even more so by atomic reactors.  Kevin further fills us in about the bad times at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where thoroughly corrupted William Magwood refuses to resign despite his multitude of direct conflicts of interest with the industry he is supposed to regulate.  We’re then joined by PAUL GUNTER, also of Beyond Nuclear, who exposes the conflicts between the United Nations and the horrific health impacts of the radiation from Fukushima.  Long-standing commitments have made the UN a pro-nuke organization.  With the World Health Organization compromised by agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN refuses to face  the health impacts of atomic energy.    As Paul and Kevin make clear, given what is happening at Fukushima, those impacts are worsening by the day.
