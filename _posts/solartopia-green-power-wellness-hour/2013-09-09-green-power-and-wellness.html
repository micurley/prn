NUKE VICTORIES and ATOMIC DISASTERS are with us at this Solartopia Green Power &amp; Wellness Show.
<!--more-->
 Long-time No Nukes heroes DEB KATZ and PAUL GUNTER illuminate the nuts and bolts of the epic four-decade-long battle that has finally won the announced shut-down of Vermont Yankee. <br />
 Their stellar work provides a primer in how grassroots organizing can change the world. <br />
 Paul then reports on PANDORA’S PROMISE, the obscene dis-infomercial now pushed at CNN and elsewhere by backers of an untested corporate-sponsored pre-failed reactor technology. <br />
 We finish with the latest horrifying news from FUKUSHIMA, which only gets worse on an apocalyptic scale. <br />
 Wanna eat PACIFIC FISH? <br />
 Forget about it! <br />
 Forever!!<br />
