DR.
<!--more-->
KING WOULD HAVE FOUGHT FRACKING….<br />
and much more about his legacy of non-violent activism for peace, social justice and survival. <br />
 Stefanie Spear, editor/publisher of the EcoWatch website and Dr Bob Fitrakis of Freepress.<br />
org join HarveyW to commemorate Martin Luther King and the 2d inauguration of Barack Obama, whose environmental legacy is very much up for grabs, especially in the era of corporate personhood and Citizens United, whose third anniversary we mourn. <br />
 This far-reaching, free-wheeling discussion of the deep-rooted connection between the “triplets” of racism, militarism and social injustice makes the indelible link to our modern struggle to save this planet and win Solartopia.
