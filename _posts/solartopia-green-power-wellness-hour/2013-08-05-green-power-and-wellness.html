LEONAR PELTIER and NATIVE AMERICAN WISDOMKEEPERS fill this Green Power &amp; Wellness Show.
<!--more-->
 Former National Geographics editor and writer HARVEY ARDEN shares his intimate knowledge of the Peltier case and the “shadows” that occupy its every corner. <br />
 Imprisoned by the energy companies since the 1970s, Leonard’s tragic story cries out for justice at www.whoisleonardpeltier.<br />
info. <br />
 Arden’s Wisdomkeepers: Meetings with Native American Spiritual Elders brings us Oren Lyons, Two Trees and a host of deeply inspired teachers whose lessons of life and justice have been lost in a world thus far unable (or unwilling) to comprehend Nature’s true powers. <br />
