The OPTIMISTIC FUTURIST Fran Koster joins Harvey Wasserman on the GREEN POWER &amp; WELLNESS SHOW to talk about the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

mega-conversion to renewables and the micro-victories people can win in their own communities. <br />
Fran changed the world by organizing the mid 1970s TOWARD TOMORROW FAIR at UMass to feature  renewables guru Amory Lovins, wind pioneer William Heronemus and many other great visionaries who shone the light on the solutions to a world being killed by King CONG (Coal, Oil, Nukes &amp; Gas). <br />
Fran’s book DISCOVERING THE NEW AMERICA also gives us beautiful small stories about how communities have bettered their lives through simple campaigns on issues like when in the morning to begin middle school, how kids should wash their hands and what it can mean to teach prisoners how to cook. <br />
See still more at www.optimisticfuturist.org. 

We finish with Aaron Klein of GREENERCORNERS.<br />
COM, a rising small business that has placed more than a thousand metal recycling containers in public places. <br />
Aaron sells advertising on the containers which are emptied by local recycling businesses and save their host communities serious money in trash management and tipping fees. <br />
A classic case of green entrepreneurship, Aaron provides an optimistic reality to our booming Solartopian future. <br />
