JUDSON of the Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service. <br />
 This authoritative survey by the IPCC has offered a powerful endorsement of renewable energy as the ultimate solution to our climate chaos, and Scott and Tim explain how.
<br />
In particular, the IPCC warns that the world must take action very quickly to save our climate balance, but that with renewables and efficiency it can be done. <br />
 It lays out many of the serious problems with atomic power and should help put to bed the false notion that nukes can help. <br />
 
In fact, both Tim and Scott lay out the details of why the transition we must make leaves nukes in their radioactive dust.
<br />
Don’t miss this definitive dive into the devastating details of why climate change is real and how renewables can solve the problems that atomic energy has made so much worse.
