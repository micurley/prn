FUKUSHIMA, CHERNOBYL AND THE GREAT HEALTH IMPACT COVERUP are with us through Dr.
<!--more-->
Janette Sherman, Joe Mangano and Professor Sarah D. <br />
Phillips. <br />
 Dr Sherman and Joe Mangano are among the tiny group of scientists and researchers who have investigated the impacts of the fallout from these disasters, and their findings are not good. <br />
 In particular, they warn that Fukushima’s radiation has fallout has impacted us here in the United States. <br />
 Prof. <br />
Phillips has found disturbing parallels between treatment of fallout victims in “democratic” Japan with those in the “dictatorial” former Soviet Union. <br />
 It all reminds us, unfortunately, of what also happened in central Pennsylvania following the 1979 disaster at Three Mile Island. <br />
  Finally Ace Hoffman fills us in on the latest nonsense at SAN ONOFRE, two reactors in California’s tsunami/earthquake zones. <br />
 They are now shut, but utility attempts to reopen them could bring us new Chernobyl/Fukushimas of our own. <br />
