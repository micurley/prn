California’s DIABLO CANYON Nuclear Power Power Plant is surrounded by at least a dozen earthquake faults.
<!--more-->
 Legendary lead attorney JOHN GEESMAN of the ALLIANCE 4 NUCLEAR RESPONSIBILITY explains why it needs to shut as soon as possible, and how that might actually happen.
<br />
Geesman is an extremely articulate, focused expert on Diablo whose in-depth knowledge and legal acumen have been significant underpinnings of the opposition for many years.
<br />
In this full-hour interview he explains the origins of the now-infamous report by Dr Michael Peck, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety expert, warning that the reactors cannot withstand a likely quake. <br />
 Nearly all the nearby fault lines have been discovered since the reactors were built.
<br />
Geesman also explains critical water issues that could arise within state regulatory network that could lead to Diablo being shut.
<br />
These two nukes could irradiate all of North America. <br />
 Don’t miss this core discussion about how we might turn them off. <br />
 NOW!!!
