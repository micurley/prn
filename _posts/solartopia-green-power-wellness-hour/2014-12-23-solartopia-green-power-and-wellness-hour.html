COCAINE BY THE TON brought into America with a blind eye from the CIA.
<!--more-->
 Radio legend DENNIS BERNSTEIN of KPFA’s Flashpoints Show broke many of the key stories around the Iran-Contra Scandal through which the “Just Say No” Reagan regime funneled cash from drug sales to help overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. <br />
 Dennis worked with reporter Gary Webb who also did key reporting on this story, but was then driven to suicide by relentless official attacks on him and his career.<br />
Dennis is also witness to HUGE ON-GOING STREET DEMONSTRATIONS in Berkeley, California, where thousands of young people are marching daily against police violence—and being subjected to still more. <br />
 A veteran broadcaster, Dennis tells us further about the future of community radio. <br />
 And as an accomplished poet, he reads to us from his superb SPECIAL ED anthology. <br />
 Don’t miss this very special hour with a gifted and important pillar of America’s humanist community. <br />
