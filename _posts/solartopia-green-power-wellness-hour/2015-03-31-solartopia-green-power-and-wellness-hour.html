MOVE TO AMEND (https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment ) wants to change our Constitution so corporations can’t<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
buy our elections and run our government. <br />
 We’re joined by Frank Hribar of Mentor, Ohio, a long-time Move to Amend activist who tells us about the resolution passed by his small home town demanding an end to corporate domination. <br />
 A state-wide convention just held in central Ohio has joined a national wave of activism aimed at finding ways to free our political and economic systems from the curse of corporate personhood. <br />
 

In the course of our discussion we read through the actual amendment designed to restore power to the public. <br />
 Be sure to take a listen.
<br />

We’re then joined by GEORGE SAKHEIM, a 91-year-old Jewish World War II vet, born in Germany, who translated the testimony of Nazi #2 Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg trials. <br />
 An unrepentant Goering made no apologies for his murderous actions. <br />
 

Nor did Rudolph Hoess, SS Commandant of Auschwitz, who was personally responsible for at least 2.<br />
5 million deaths. <br />
 Sakheim tells us that at the end of his life, the rock-hard Hoess confessed his “sins” and asked forgiveness. <br />
 

Sakheim’s unique, astounding story from the very core of the post-Nazi inferno must be heard to be believed. <br />
