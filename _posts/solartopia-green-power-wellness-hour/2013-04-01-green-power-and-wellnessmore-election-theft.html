ELECTION THEFT AND THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY are center stage as BOB FITRAKIS joins the Green Power &amp; Wellness<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Show to talk about the litany of ways we are denied our voice. <br />
  A new generation of Jim Crow laws deny people of color, elders, young people, poor people and other suspected small-d voters of our rights. <br />
 Electronic voting machines flip the ballot count. <br />
 Gerrymandered Congressional and statewide districts entrench a moneyed minority. <br />
 Money in politics and corporate personhood lock in the power of the super-rich. <br />
 The Senate filibuster makes the possibility of appointing a person with democratic views to the US Supreme Court. <br />
 As we sum up the barriers to our democracy, we also hear from ACE HOFFMAN about the latest insanities at California’s SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR unit 2, where the utilities want to run a damaged reactor, near earthquake faults in a tsunami zone, as an “experiment” with 8 million people in the vicinity—and all the rest of us downwind.
