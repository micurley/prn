The ATTACK ON RENEWABLES IN OHIO is dissected and made understandable by the brilliant NED FORD, the Cincinnati-based<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
expert who has translated the state’s mutated energy policies for years on end.
<br />
In 2008 Ohio adopted a forward-looking bi-partisan energy policy designed to promote efficiency and renewables and bring Ohio into the 21st Century. <br />
 Like other midwestern states, Ohio has been hooked on coal. <br />
 But to meet federal air quality standards, many of the old Buckeye coal burners are scheduled to shut down in 2016. <br />
 Ohio’s excellent northern wind resource, plus new renewable and efficiency, have been poised to pick up the slack.
<br />
But since 2010 and the coming of a new Republican regime, led by Governor John Kasich, an industry attack has gutted Ohio’s green-powered future….<br />
and with it the prospects of many other states who are following in the same polluted footprint.
<br />
Ned Ford provides us a stunningly clear, concise picture of how this is happening. <br />
 If you are interested in a green-powered future, this show is a vital resource. <br />
