PAUL KRASSNER, Americaâ€™s pioneer investigative satirist, takes us partway through his astonishing career.
<!--more-->
Â 
We begin with a violin concerto alone on the stage of Carnegie Hall at age 6. <br />
Paul spins us through how he scratched an itchy leg with his other foot, drawing the laughs that would define his career.
<br />
We meet him at MAD Magazine and carry through the founding of The Realist, Americanâ€™s first adult satirical periodical. <br />
Â Â We meet Lennie Bruce, Allen Ginsberg, Abbie and Anita Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and a host of those whoâ€™ve shaped our nation.
<br />
We also take an LSD trip on the witness stand of the Chicago 8 Conspiracy Trial, and much more.
<br />
At 83, Paul is a national treasure. <br />
Â Be sure to hear the beginnings of his amazing story, which we will continue at a later dateâ€Ś.<br />
