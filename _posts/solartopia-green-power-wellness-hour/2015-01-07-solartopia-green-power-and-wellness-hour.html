An astonishing direct link to the NAZI HOLOCAUST comes from the brilliant 91-year-old DR. GEORGE SAKHEIM.  Dr.
<!--more-->
Sakheim was born in Berlin in 1923, lived in Palestine in the 1930s and then came to New York to study at Columbia University.<br />
Drafted into the US Army, he entered into Normandy a week after the June 5, 1944, D-Day invasion and served as an interrogator of German prisoners until May, 1945. <br />
 He then became an interpreter at the NUREMBERG TRIALS, and translated the horrifying, immutably obscene testimony of Nazi war criminals. <br />
 His verbatim transcripts include the unrepentant words Hermann Goering, Hitler’s #2 commander, and Rudolph Hoess, Commandant of the Auschwitz Death Camp.Dr Sakheim’s experiences are unique, his life story absolutely riveting, and his accounts of the Nazi testimony horrifying almost beyond belief.<br />
We will have Dr Sakheim back to fill in his views on what the Nazis did, their state of mind at Nuremberg, and on our own nation’s conduct in extracting information from prisoners of war. <br />
 Do not miss this compelling testimony from the depths of humankind’s darkest chapters of history. <br />
