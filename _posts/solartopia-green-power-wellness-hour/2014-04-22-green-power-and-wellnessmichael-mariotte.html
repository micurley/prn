<!--more-->
Resource Service and editor of the GREENWORLD Blog.<br />
Michael’s unique expertise takes us on a tour of the collapsing nuclear power industry in Europe, the US and Japan while we ride on the astonishing rise of the global renewable energy industry. <br />
 As Michael points out, it’s now cheaper in many parts of the United States to solar on your rooftop and leave the grid altogether than it is to stay with the dying fossil-nuke dinosaur.As we celebrate our planet, don’t miss hearing from a life-long activist whose unique power &amp; expertise has helped make our staying much more feasible.<br />
