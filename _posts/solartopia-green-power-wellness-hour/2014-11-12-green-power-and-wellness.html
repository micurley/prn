HOW THE GOP BOUGHT, RIGGED, STOLE &amp; LYNCHED THE 2014 ELECTION is our terrifying &amp; infuriating topic as we hear<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
from the great GREG PALAST and my co-conspirator BOB FITRAKIS, two of America’s leading experts on election protection.<br />
Bob &amp; Greg have both reported on the theft of American elections since George W. <br />
Bush did it in 2000. <br />
 After a 6-month pre-election investigation, Greg has concluded that at least three US Senate races and at least three governorships were outright stolen this year through the use of Crosscheck, an Orwellian computer-based system employed by the GOP to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of African-American and other voters of color.<br />
As Bob and I have reported extensively from Ohio, the purging of voter rolls and other dirty tricks has solidified GOP control of America’s key swing state. <br />
 No one concerned about what’s left of American democracy should miss this show.
