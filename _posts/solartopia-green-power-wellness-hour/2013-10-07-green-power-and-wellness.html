HELEN CALDICOTT explains the killing power of radiation and the horrific dangers we face from the fallout at Fukushima, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and your local nuclear plant. <br />
 Speaking to us from Australia, Dr Caldicott points out that radiation levels soared in Seattle after the Fukushima disaster, and that the health of 80% of the children downwind from Chernobyl has been compromised. <br />
 Do not miss this critical discussion of what we all now face from the fallout of atomic energy, “peaceful” and otherwise.
