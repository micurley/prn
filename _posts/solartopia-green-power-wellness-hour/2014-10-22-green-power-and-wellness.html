nation. <br />
 Linda has worked in San Luis Obispo, California, for more than thirty years to close the two huge reactors at DIABLO CANYON, half way between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
<br />

These aged, deteriorating nukes are surrounded by earthquake faults. <br />
 More people have been arrested there than at any other reactor site in the US. <br />
 Should they suffer a major accident, their radiation would pour across the entire North American continent.
<br />

But now their owner, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, is uniquely vulnerable. <br />
 A powerful grassroots upsurge is moving fast forward to shut them down. <br />
 Hear all about it with this great long-time activist.
