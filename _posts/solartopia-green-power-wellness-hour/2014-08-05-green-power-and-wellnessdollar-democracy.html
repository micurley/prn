nation from the big corporations. <br />
 A writer, teacher, Congressional candidate, Peter is an informed, energetic advocate for the power of the people. <br />
   With his book in hand we cover issues of money in politics, the Constitutional Amendment (”Move to Amend”) we need to deal with it, with war and empire, GMOs, education and much much more along the path to an enlightened, empowered grassroots nation. <br />
 In the opening to DOLLAR DEMOCRACY, the late great Senator Paul Wellstone says “politics is about the improvement of people’s lives.<br />
”  Peter Mathews beautifully expounds how his happens in this bracing, energetic chapter of the ride to Solartopia. <br />
