The GREAT GREEN TRANSITION is explained by global carbon expert CHARLES KOMANOFF whose grasp of the world energy<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

situation is unmatched. <br />
 Charles talks to us about the CARBON TAX and the on-going decline in per capita miles driven by Americans. <br />
 His www.carbontax.org website lays out the details of the critical transition we must make to federal taxation of carbon emissions and how that’ll effect both our economy and our climate.<br />
Charles also explains German’s great ENERGIEWENDE, the transition to a green-powered Solartopian economy where all fossil fuels and nuclear power are being phased out. <br />
 The astonishing success of this movement is transforming the future of energy worldwide, in part by driving down the cost of solar panels. <br />
 But as the world’s fourth-largest economy shows it can be done, Charles Komanoff explains for us the compelling and profitable implications for the green-powered world to come.
