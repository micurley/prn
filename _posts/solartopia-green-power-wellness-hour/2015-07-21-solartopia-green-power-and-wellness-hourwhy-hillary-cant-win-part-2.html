World-renowned election protection expert BOB FITRAKIS joins us again from central Ohio to further explore the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

electronic challenges facing any non-Republican candidate for president and other office in 2016. <br />
 
The safe assumption that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee makes it incumbent upon us all to explore how the election is likely to be stolen. <br />
 Our experience with mainstream Democrats like Ms. <br />
Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry indicates that as in 2000 and 2004, they are likely to do nothing to expose the obvious manipulation and theft of our voting process. <br />
 
So as members of the Green Party, Dr Fitrakis and HarveyW discuss the various steps that could be taken to protect the process in 2016. <br />
Harvey was a plaintiff and Bob the lead attorney in the successful King-Lincoln-Bronzeville federal lawsuit that exposed much of what had been done to steal the 2004 election. <br />
 In this series we prepare for the next round of battle in an electoral system that is yet again on the brink of being bought, rigged, lynched and flipped. <br />
