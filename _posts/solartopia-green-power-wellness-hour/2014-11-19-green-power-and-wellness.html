ELECTION THEFT in our own “democratic” United States as the GOP has tightened its grip on the levers of power.
<!--more-->
 We are joined by my co-conspirator BOB FITRAKIS and by JONATHAN SIMON, author of CODE RED:  COMPUTERIZED ELECTION THEFT &amp; THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY.<br />
We discuss Simon’s warning that without hand-counted paper ballots, we have nothing resembling a democracy in this country. <br />
 That the “Red Shift” from legitimate voting to an outcome increasingly dominated by Republican “victors” has rendered our electoral system an empty shell.<br />
And that it will take a huge grassroots upheaval to retrieve our right to vote in any meaningful manner. <br />
 Fitrakis and Simon point out, for example, that despite overwhelming Democratic majorities both Pennsylvania and Ohio have Congressional delegations totally dominated by Republicans. <br />
 And that without meaningful change, it may not be worth voting at all.<br />
Don’t miss this in-depth discussion of yet another aspect of our corrupted electoral process, and what to do about it.
<br />
