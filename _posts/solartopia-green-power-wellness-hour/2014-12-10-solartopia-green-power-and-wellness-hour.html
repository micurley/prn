DIABLO CANYON!!!
<!--more-->
 Two huge old NUKES surrounded by earthquake faults, dumping radioactive hot water into the ocean, costing the public money, stalling the Solartopia Age….how do we SHUT THEM DOWN?We hear from DAMON MOGLEN of FRIENDS OF THE EARTH and LINDA SEELEY of the San Luis Obispo MOTHERS FOR PEACE about the escalating public campaign to free California from all its nukes and render our precious coastline sustainable and clean.Damon &amp; Linda tell us first about the fantastic public victory in shutting two reactors at SAN ONOFRE between Los Angeles &amp; San Diego, and how we must now proceed to do the same at Diablo.<br />
The Diablo reactors are under legal and regulatory attack for their owners’ lies about seismic activity, hot water emissions, economic issues and so much more. <br />
 Tune in to these two great expert/activists to find out how we turn this corner in California’s march to a non-nuclear Solartopia. <br />
