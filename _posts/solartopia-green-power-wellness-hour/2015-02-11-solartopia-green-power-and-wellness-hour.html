THE WORLD’S MOST DANGEROUS NUKE might well be DAVIS-BESSE near Toledo, Ohio.
<!--more-->
Its Keystone Kop litany of shoddy construction, operator mishap and completely uncaring mis-management is unique—and uniquely dangerous.
<br />
But Ohio citizens now have a chance to shut it down by denying it the huge rate hike its owners are asking for this crumbling, decrepit reactor and at least one additional coal burner.
<br />
We’re joined by local attorney TERRY LODGE and KEVIN KAMPS of BEYOND NUCLEAR, along with TIM JUDSON of the NUCLEAR INFORMATION &amp; RESOURCE SERVICE. <br />
They fill us in on the sorry history and perilous present of this insanely faulty reactor.
<br />
Join us to hear atomic realities you couldn’t make up. <br />
Here’s how you might help shut this thing:
Write the PUCO at: docketing@puc.state.oh.us

OPPOSITION COMMENT UNDER CASE # 14-1297-EL-SSO<br />
