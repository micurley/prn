TRUTHDIG.COM Managing Editor PETER SCHEER joins us for a free-range romp through today’s political scene, from Barack<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Obama and the politics of race to nuclear power, global warming and the grim realities of the Los Angeles “River” and its desperate restoration.
<br />
Peter manages one of America’s few remaining independent news outlets, a lively, eclectic website that has somehow survived the winds of change at the intersect between the internet and the news biz. <br />
