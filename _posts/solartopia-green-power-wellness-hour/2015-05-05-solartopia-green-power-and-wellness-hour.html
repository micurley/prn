The escalating campaign to LEGALIZE CANNABIS is work of our superb guest ERIC STERLING, President of the Criminal<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Justice Policy Foundation and a commissioner on the Maryland state board investigating medical marijuana there.
<br />
Eric first testified for legalizing cannabis to the Pennsylvania legislature more than four decades ago. <br />
 He recalls for us the 1972 Schafer Commission, empowered by Richard Nixon, that advocated decriminalization. <br />
 Nixon did his best to suppress the findings, which came from a Republican Governor of Pennsylvania. <br />
 But 43 years later, after more than a million arrests, its wisdom is obvious.
<br />
With his decades of leadership on the issue, Eric takes us through the realities of legalization on Colorado and Washington, as well as the recent approval of medical cannabis in Puerto Rico. <br />
 He emphasizes that the term “marijuana” was adopted in the 1930s as a race-based stigmatization for cannabis, which is has been used by humankind for a wide range of purposes for many millennia.
<br />
Eric also emphasizes the racial and political injustices still being perpetrated by a Drug War whose primary function has been to keep the rich in power while demonizing and disenfranchising those of youth and color.
