PROTECTING THE VOTE and Shutting DIABLO CANYON &amp; NUKE WASTE  light up this hour in Solartopia.NINA TURNER,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State, describes the Republican Party’s bleak assault on the public’s ability to vote, and how Jim Crow is grabbing power with phony charges of voter fraud which essentially does not exist.<br />
Then BILL WALKER of FRIENDS OF THE EARTH updates us on the monumental lawsuit just filed to force DIABLO CANYON to meet earthquake protection specifications. <br />
 After an insider report warning that Diablo cannot withstand shaking from the many earthquake faults that surround it, “regulators” changed specifications to allow it to continue to operate. <br />
 FOE’s lawsuit will be watched worldwide, &amp; especially by millions of downwind Californians whose lives are immediately threatened.<br />
Finally, DIANE D’ARRIGO of the NUCLEAR INFORMATION &amp; RESOURCE SERVICE describes the upcoming (11/10) event honoring the great MICHAEL MARIOTTE, whose decades of activism have made such a difference in the world of atomic energy. <br />
 Diane also explains the current state of nuke waste management, including the failure of Yucca Mountain and the disastrous events at NM’s Waste Isolation Pilot Project costing millions of dollars and casting a very long shadow on any attempt to deal with atomic power’s fiendish residue. <br />
