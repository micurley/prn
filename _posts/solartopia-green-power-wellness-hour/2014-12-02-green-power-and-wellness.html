 Repeat:  here is a multi-trillion-dollar operation, meant to “protect” the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and we who are forced to pay for it cannot follow the money.Hear the whole astounding story from Peter, whose many books and speeches have helped enlighten us all.<br />
Then we’re joined by NINA STREICH, organizer of the wonderful Global Peace Film Festival based for more than a decade in Orlando, Florida. <br />
