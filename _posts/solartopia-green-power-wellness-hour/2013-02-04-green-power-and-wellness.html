David Swanson, one of America’s great peace activists, graces this Solartopia Green Power &amp; Wellness Show.
<!--more-->
 David joins Harvey to talk about the killing of Osama bin Laden and the imperial wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. <br />
 His brilliant research on the 1920s Kellogg-Briand Accord that brought peace to the planet for a precious two decades highlights an hour full of activism and hope as we look forward to a time when our nation moves beyond the military and into a green-powered age full of love and promise. <br />
