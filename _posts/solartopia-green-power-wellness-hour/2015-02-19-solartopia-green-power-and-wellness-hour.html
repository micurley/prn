The great DR.
<!--more-->
HELEN CALDICOTT comes to us live from Australia with news of her upcoming NUCLEAR FREE PLANET SYMPOSIUM ( http://nuclearfreeplanet.<br />
org) scheduled for February 28/March 1 in New York City. <br />
 Helen’s astonishing global network has attracted some of the world’s great thinkers on nuclear issues including NOAM CHOMSKY, BOB ALVAREZ, BRUCE GAGNON and many others to a summit discussion of how our species might survive in a nuke-saturated situation.<br />
Helen begins with a disturbing discussion of actions in Ukraine and the threat to the 15 atomic reactors still operating there. <br />
 She warns that the death toll from Chernobyl has climbed over a million and that the western campaign to “back Putin into a corner” is fraught with danger.<br />
She also recalls seeing the film classic ON THE BEACH as a teenager and the impact it had, leading her to show it again at the upcoming symposium. <br />
 Dr Caldicott always brings the very best in medical and ecological wisdom. <br />
Don’t miss her latest visit to Solartopia. <br />
