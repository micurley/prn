We start our SOLARTOPIA GREEN POWER &amp; WELLNESS SHOW with the campaign to save the famous CHAIN REACTION statue that<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
now graces downtown Santa Monica. <br />
 Dave Conrad, son of the famed cartoonist, tells us of the popular movement to preserve this unique 26-foot-high monument to ending the nuclear age.
<br />
Then we explore the MYTH OF NUCLEAR SWORDS TO PLOUGHSHARES as exposed by Georgia activist Glenn Carroll. <br />
 We examine the realities of the hugely over-budget Savannah River Project in South Carolina. <br />
 This immense federal boondoggle was meant to convert weapons-grade plutonium into commercial reactor fuel but has jumped in price by a factor of at least ten, and the Obama Administration is, thankfully, working to pull the plug. <br />
 Along with the chaotic construction problems at Georgia’ Vogtle and Summer in South Carolina, Glenn tells us in depth how the future of nuclear power in the southeast is very much in doubt.
<br />
Glenn also shocks us with the news that the TEA PARTY in Georgia has been moved to action by soaring nuclear subsidies, and is now FIGHTING HARD FOR SOLAR POWER, a first as best we can tell in the entire nation. <br />
 Join us in Solartopia to hear it all!!!
