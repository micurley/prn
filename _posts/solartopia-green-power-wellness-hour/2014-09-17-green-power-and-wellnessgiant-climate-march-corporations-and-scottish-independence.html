---

Our Solartopian conversation about the GIANT CLIMATE MARCH, CORPORATIONS and SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE is with DAVID<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
MORRIS of the Institution for Local Self-Reliance and HARRIET BARLOW of the Blue Mountain Center.
<br />

These great long-time activists fill us in on the origins of the global 9/21 march on climate change and how it relates to issues of corporate control.<br />
  They will be marching with the masses this weekend to end global warming amidst a huge array of meetings and organizing.
<br />

David has also authored an important article on this week’s vote on SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE ( http://www.ilsr.<br />
org/scotland-sovereignty-corporations/ ) and explains its critical importance in terms of a global movement for smaller countries. <br />
 

The corporations will counter-attack, he warns. <br />
 But Scotland may open a Third Wave of new country formation that could make our world a better place.  Let’s Hope!!!
<br />
