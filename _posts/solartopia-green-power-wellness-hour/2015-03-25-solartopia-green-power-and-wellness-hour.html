A SOLAR-POWERED EARTH is our topic with the astonishing STEVE STRONG, one of our great green pioneers.
<!--more-->
Steve’s SOLAR DESIGN company has blown through many of the corporate and regulatory barriers to bring renewable technologies into the engineering and construction mainstream. <br />
Among other things, Steve coordinated the solar installations at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, the world’s leading learning institution for the spread of renewable technologies.
<br />
After a stint working on the Alaska pipeline, Steve founded Solar Design in the mid 1970s to push sustainable energy use into a whole new frontier of home, office and industrial construction. <br />
Today his company is promoting community-based solar model that can allow people whose rooftops can’t sustain photovoltaic panels to own their own renewable generation with shared solar farms.
<br />
Steve makes it clear that the technologies that now plague our planet—coal, oil, nukes &amp;amp; gas—can be effectively replaced with renewables bringing their huge upsides of economy, community control and ecological preservation.<br />
 
We are also visited by FRANK DEBAR of MOVE TO AMEND, who announces for us this upcoming weekend’s conference at the Unitarian Church at 95 Weishheimer Road in Columbus, Ohio. <br />
Aimed at overturning corporate personhood and all its many plagues, we’ll have a full report on this conference and the on-going work Move to Amend is doing on a later show.<br />
