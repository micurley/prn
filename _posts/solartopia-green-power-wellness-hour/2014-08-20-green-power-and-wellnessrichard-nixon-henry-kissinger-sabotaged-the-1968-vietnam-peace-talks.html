RICHARD NIXON &amp; HENRY KISSINGER SABOTAGED THE 1968 VIETNAM PEACE TALKS and cursed us all with 7 more years of war<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
and hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths. <br />
 This “leftist conspiracy theory” which has been dismissed by the right for so many decades has now been definitively confirmed and is 100% part of the “mainstream” American legacy. <br />
 DAVID SWANSON, one of America’s great peace writer/activists, and attorney BOB FITRAKIS, publisher of www.freepress.<br />
org, professor of political science, thoroughly document this explosive reality now being so blithely ignored by the corporate media. <br />
 Bob and David also explore, as only they can, the illegal lies that led us into the wars in Iraq and Libya, as well as George HW Bush’s treasonous delay of the release American hostages in Iran, guaranteeing the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan. <br />
 Proving once again that yesterday’s “conspiracy theory” is tomorrow’s proven historic reality, David and Bob plumb the depths of an imperial war machine that threatens us all while denying it all with ever-decreasing credibility. <br />
