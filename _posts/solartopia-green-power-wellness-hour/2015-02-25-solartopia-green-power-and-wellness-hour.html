With guest MARK DOWIE, one of the great investigative reporters of our generation.
<!--more-->
 Decades ago Mark broke the Ford Pinto story, and has followed it with literally scores of investigative pieces that have helped change the world.
<br />

Mark is now working on a fascinating book about the HAIDA GWAII, an astonishing First Nation living on about 150 islands in the great Canadian northwest. <br />
 The Haida Gwaii have successfully protected their beautiful lands from extractive industries in a unique centuries-long campaign that Mark will explain in his next book, being published by Inkshares. <br />
 Don’t miss this amazing discussion. <br />
