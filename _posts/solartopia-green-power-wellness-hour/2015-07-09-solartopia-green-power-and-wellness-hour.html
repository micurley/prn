ATOMIC POWER and the BIRTH OF GREENPEACE!
<!--more-->
KEVIN KAMPS joins us from BEYOND NUCLEAR to fill us in on the latest developments in the fight to shut the atomic reactor business. <br />
 With nuke owners begging legislatures in Illinois and Ohio for bailouts, and for help in dealing with radioactive waste, this “too cheap to meter” technology never looked more bankrupt.
<br />
Then GREENPEACE co-founder REX WEYLER talks to us about stricken singer JONI MITCHELL. <br />
 And about the rise and current prosperity of one of the world’s great environmental organizations. <br />
 
It’s always a joy to talk to these two great activists. <br />
 JOIN US!!!
