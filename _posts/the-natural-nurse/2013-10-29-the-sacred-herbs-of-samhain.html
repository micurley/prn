Eugene Zampieron, ND, MH, www.drznaturally.<br />
com, discuss the ancient healing herbal traditions of Samhain. <br />
Now called Halloween, Samhain  is one of the oldest holidays with origins dating back to an ancient Celtic festival, which heralded  summer’s end on October 31st. <br />
– and brought in the New Year on November 1st. <br />
The Celtic people believed all laws of space and time were suspended during this time, allowing the spirit world to intermingle with the living. <br />
In addition to many sacred traditions, herbal medicine was part of the milieu, which led to modern practices, such as bobbing for apples, and beliefs about garlic warding off evil, Lavender dispelling negativity, and St. <br />
John’s wort casting out devils. <br />
We will explore these and other ancient Druid traditions , on todays show. <br />
