Host Ellen Kamhi PhD RN, www.naturalnurse.com interviews Kate Mendenhall Executive Director, Northeast Organic Farming<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Association of New York (NOFA-NY) Kate first explored organic farming during a two-year tour of volunteering on organic farms from Mexico to Japan. <br />
 After returning to the US, she began working on policy issues with the New York Sustainable Agriculture Working Group (NYSAWG). <br />
 She participated in the Cornell LEAD-NY program for agricultural leadership and became familiar with all aspects of the state food system. <br />
 In 2006, Kate joined NOFA-NY as the projects coordinator—developing educational programs for farmers, gardeners, and consumers. <br />
 She became the Executive Director in 2009 to continue NOFA-NY’s work in statewide education and advocacy that aims to build a sustainable regional food system. <br />
 With her husband, Zach Borus, she grows fruits and veggies and raises three chickens in her Rochester, NY urban garden. <br />
  On today’s show, Kate will focus on legislative issues that can impack the availability to wholesome organic food. <br />
