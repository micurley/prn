Ellen Kamhi, PhD RN, www.naturalnurse.com, Facebook-The Natural Nurse, interviews Dr. Earl Mindell.
<!--more-->
 Earl Mindell is a pharmacist and has authored over 45 books on health and wellness. <br />
He is a strong advocate of  natural interventions including nutrition and homeopathy. <br />
As a nutritionist, lecturer, and author, Dr Mindell is excited about the world of nutrition and its relationship to health and wellness. <br />
In 1965, when Dr Mindell opened his first pharmacy, he realized how many drugs people were taking, simply to get through the day. <br />
As he investigated nutrition, he was  excited about  its relationship to health and wellness, and decided to focus on wellness instead of ’sick care’ through drugs. <br />
He then wrote his groundbreaking book, THE VITAMIN BIBLE, with many more books to follow. <br />
Today, we will discuss his new book, NUTRITION BIBLE. <br />
