interviews Dr Anna Kelles, Director of the School of Applied Clinical Nutrition at New York Chiropractic College. <br />
 Dr Kelles has dedicated her career to elucidating the connections between nutrition, human health, and the health of our environment. <br />
   At Binghamton University she began a formal exploration into human and environmental health through a dual bachelor in Biology and Environmental studies. <br />
 She studied macrobiotic nutrition at the Kushi Institute and spent years in a remote Ecuadorian village exploring the nutritional status of children and household environmental conditions and promoting sound nutritional and environmental practices, and worked as a high school biology teacher and guide in the jungle. <br />
Dr Kelles earned a PhD in Nutritional Epidemiology from The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. <br />
 Her research explored the long term impact of globalization on divergent dietary and physical activity patterns between Filipino mothers and children. <br />
   Dr Kelles has published several articles as well as a book chapter exploring deleterious dietary behavior patterns in developed and developing countries and subsequent policy recommendations. <br />
 Dr Kelles has assembled a team of expert faculty to deliver one of the only online graduate programs focused on whole foods therapeutic nutrition for  clinicians, at New York Chiropractic College.
