<!--more-->
Christopher Vasey is a naturopath and author living in Chamby-Montreux, Switzerland.<br />
He studied naturopathy in Paris, and started his private practice in 1979. <br />
Alongside his therapeutic work, he continued his formation by studying the works of famous naturopaths such as Dr Paul Carton, Herbert Shelton, Robert Masson, R. <br />
Jackson, Kneipp, and others. <br />
From 1988 onwards, he started to author an ever growing collection of books, including “The Acid alkaline Diet”, “The Naturopathic Way”, and “Optimal Detox”. <br />
Christopher Vasey lectures regularly in Europe (Switzerland, France, Scandinavia, Iceland …), in the USA and Canada. <br />
On today’s show, we focus on his book, Natural Remedies for Inflammation.
<br />
In this practical guide he explores 18 anti-inflammatory herbs, such as bay laurel, basil, turmeric, and devil’s claw, as well as 15 other natural substances, such as propolis and fish oil. <br />
He explains which conditions each addresses most effectively, proper dosage, and the best methods of ingestion.
