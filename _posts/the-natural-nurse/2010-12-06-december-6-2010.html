Dr. Eugene Zampieron, ND, AHG, www.drznaturally.com, interviews Dr. Michael Lipelt, DDS, ND, L.Ac.
<!--more-->
Known as the eclectic doctor, Michael Lipelt is the founder of Stillpoint Family Health Services (SFHS). <br />
Dr Lipelt holds degrees from UC Berkeley, UCLA School of Dentistry, is a licensed acupuncturist and a Bastyr Educated Naturopathic Physician. <br />
Dr Lipelt brings together years of diverse professional training as both a dentist and a Naturopathic Physician, to tailor a unique, personalized solution to support and assist his patientâ€™s natural healing ability and to achieve their health goals. <br />
Dr Lipelt was led on a path to natural medicine 30 years ago after hurting his back in a bike accident, and finding no cure or relief using conventional, allopathic medicine. <br />
The resulting chronic pain and restricted movement interfered with his job as a dentist in Santa Rosa, CA and hampered his active lifestyle. <br />
Being a runner and athlete, he elected to forego surgery, and started his own journey in natural medicine. <br />
His injury led him to study many natural medical systems, all with the common foundation of healthy diet and lifestyle. <br />
Looking at optimum fuel for the body led to the study of sustainable agriculture and the creation of Stillpoint Permaculture Center (SPC) on his own five acres in Sonoma County.<br />
His ongoing work in permaculture and study of Ecological Sustainable Medicine continue today , with a focus on the interconnectivity of all life and the importance of keeping a healthy balance in all aspects of life. <br />
