Host Dr.

Eugene Zampieron, www.drznaturally.com, interviews Stephen Harrod Buhner.<br />
  Stephen Buhner is the award-winning author of fifteen books on nature, indigenous cultures, the environment, and herbal medicine. <br />
He comes from a long line of healers including Leroy Burney, Surgeon General of the United States under Eisenhower and Kennedy, and Elizabeth Lusterheide, a midwife and herbalist who worked in rural Indiana in the early nineteenth century. <br />
The greatest influence on his work, however, has been his great-grandfather CG Harrod who primarily used botanical medicines, also in rural Indiana, when he began his work as a physician in 1911. <br />
Stephen’s work has appeared in publications throughout North America and Europe including Common Boundary, Apotheosis, Shaman’s Drum, The New York Times, CNN, and Good Morning America. <br />
Stephen lectures yearly throughout the United States on herbal medicine, the sacredness of plants, the intelligence of Nature, and the states of mind necessary for successful habitation of Earth. <br />
On todays show, we will discuss his book Healing Lyme Coinfections: Complementary and Alternative Treatments for Bartonella and Mycoplasma, Inner Tradtitions, April 15, 2013. <br />
