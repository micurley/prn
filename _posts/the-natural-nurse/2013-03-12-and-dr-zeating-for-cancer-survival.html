Horner, MD.
<!--more-->
Christine Horner, MD is a nationally known surgeon,
professional speaker and author of Waking the Warrior Goddess:
Dr Christine Horner’s Program to Protect Against and Fight Breast
Cancer– She holds two board certifications: the National Board of Surgery,
and the National Board of Plastic Surgery. <br />
Dr Horner was recognized as a
leader in her field shortly after starting her plastic and reconstructive
surgery practice because she successfully ran a national campaign to pass
laws requiring insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction surgery
following mastectomy. <br />
Her campaign involves several meetings with
President Clinton and other political figures. <br />
On today’s show, Dr Horner
discusses three essential supplements and three essential vitamins that
should be incorporated in anyone’s cancer-prevention diet. <br />
She will also
fill in the information gaps when it comes to dietary supplements and
highlight the important guidelines recently issued by the American Cancer
Society. <br />
