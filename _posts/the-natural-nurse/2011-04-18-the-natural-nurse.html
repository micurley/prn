 David Gann’s scientific career spans over 30 years in scientific, engineering, and management experience as an integral member of numerous scientific teams. <br />
He has been successful in developing cutting-edge technologies such as the first ultra-high-density magnetic recording medium for Zwan Magnetics (early 1980’s), which included research into the manufacture of rare-earth magnets. <br />
During the late 1990’s, in conjunction with UCLA, Mr Gann’s began his research into the detection and labeling of nano-sized particles found in homeopathic solutions. <br />
He was involved with the Department of Immunology at UCLA researching an isolated particle as a stimulant of T-cells (human immune system), with more than 57 blind studies all demonstrating dramatic significant improvements in immune response. <br />
Mr Gann has organized educational symposiums on crucial environmental issues, including global climate change and nuclear waste cleanup in conjunction with the US Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratories. <br />
Today we will discuss his new book Double Helix Water. <br />
