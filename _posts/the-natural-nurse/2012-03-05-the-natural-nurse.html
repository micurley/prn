Helayne practices holistic nutrition in Oakland, California.  She has a doctorate from the University of San Francisco, and is a graduate of Bauman College of Holistic Nutrition in Berkeley, CA.  After losing dear family and friends to cancer, she decided to devote herself to understanding how to help prevent this dreaded disease and how to improve quality of life with it.<br />
  The result was three years of research into best practices in risk assessment and nutritional support for breast cancer, the subject of the book she has co-authored with Ed Bauman – THE WHOLE FOOD GUIDE FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. <br />
