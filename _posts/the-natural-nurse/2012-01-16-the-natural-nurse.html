Deborahs’ mission was to become an advocate for her special needs twins.

Medical professionals only offered drugs. <br />
 She sought alternative methods, did extensive ADHD and other health-related research, and kept impeccable records. <br />
In 1993, she co-chaired the Westside Cities Council to help promote Public Law 99457, part H, to implement early intervention services from birth through three years of age for children at risk. <br />
In 1990 and 1991, she coordinated outreach to pediatricians (under Public Law 99457, part H) and coordinated presentations at hospitals to educate pediatricians on early intervention services and resources for children at risk from infancy to three years of age. <br />
She is a frequent guest speaker on radio shows through out the United States and Canada. <br />
 She is a consultant to parents who need support, provides resources regarding their children’s individual needs, and she is an artist.
