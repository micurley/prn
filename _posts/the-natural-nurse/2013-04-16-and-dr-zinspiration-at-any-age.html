<!--more-->
Mavis is 76-years-old and a native of Livingston,Louisiana. <br />
She was born into a family of five boys and learned to play ball at an early age. <br />
She began playing basketball in seventh grade and was on the high school team in eighth grade. <br />
Before graduating in 1954, Mavis made all district and all parish as a high school athlete. <br />
She then married and worked in the family business as well as raising three children for the next 32 years. <br />
She retired in 1992.
<br />
Mavis then read about the Senior Games and decided to get involved in basketball again. <br />
She played on the team that won the gold medal in 1993 - thanks to her 3-point shot at the buzzer that made the team the winners by one point! <br />
Mavis currently has four United States national gold medals, and 68 state and regional tournament gold medals. On Today’s show, Mavis will talk about inspiration at any age, that is an important step towards health and longevity. To view the trailer for Age of Champions, go to:www.ageofchampions.org.  To learn more about the Celadrin Tigerettes, visit:www.celadrininfo.com/tigerettes.<br />
