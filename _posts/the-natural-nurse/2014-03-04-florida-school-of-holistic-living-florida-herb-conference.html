Ruff .<br />
  Emily is the Director of the Florida School of Holistic Living and the Florida Herbal Conference. <br />
A community herbalist and health educator, her studies have taken her around three continents where she has studied under indigenous healers of many traditions. <br />
Returning to the United States, she completed apprenticeships with  admired Western herbalists, including Rosemary Gladstar, Carolyn Whitford, and George D’Arcy. <br />
The roots of her study were passed down during her childhood wandering the wilderness of Central Florida with her father, a botanist and professor, and digging in the soil with her grandfather, an urban farmer.
<br />
Emily’s academic studies include Ethnobotany at the University of Central Florida and Flower Essences through the Bach Foundation. <br />
Emily is a frequently published author, and lectures throughout Florida and the United States. <br />
In 2004, Emily launched her product line, Orenda Herbal, to provide her community with quality herbal preparations formulated with organic and locally grown ingredients. <br />
Emily’s classes have been described as “heart-filled,” “empowering,” “intellectually dynamic,” and “joyful,” and provide a bridge between the teachings of our ancestors and the technologies of our modern world. <br />
