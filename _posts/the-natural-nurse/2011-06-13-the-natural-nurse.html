Claudia lectures and teaches internationally on both Asian and Ayurvedic medicines, which she has studied for more than twenty-five years. <br />
 In her new book,  Balance Your Hormones, Balance Your Life: Achieving Optimal Health and Wellness through Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, and Western Science, author Claudia Welch explores the counterbalancing effects of sex and stress hormones, and outlines easy-to-follow strategies for self care to help women combat stress-induced medical problems ranging from painful periods, mood swings, fatigue, and insomnia to infertility, uterine fibroids, hot flashes, heart disease, and osteoporosis.

Using Eastern insights to complement Western strategies, Welch offers holistic yet practical advice for achieving optimal hormonal health. <br />
