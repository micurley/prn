Dahlberg has lived many lives — From talking to Mickey Mouse at the
 1962 Seattle World’s Fair to his modern-day role as a school teacher, 
sports and music addict, and as a father. <br />
Mr Dahlberg suffered through a
 childhood of anxieties that morphed into OCD from the age of about 14 
into his forties. <br />
Much of his own youth was spent living with an 
untreatable, unnamed condition which is now known as 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. <br />
Hiding the condition, as OCD sufferers 
do, he lived a partially functional life. <br />
Mr Dahlberg’s high academic 
aptitudes and exceptional memory allowed him to function as a reasonably
 normal person, but not the highly-functional one locked behind the bars
 of OCD. <br />
His perseverance to function and be normal drove him to fight 
his OCD every day, and, when finally curable, decades after its onset, 
this OCD was finally defeated. <br />
Now cognizant of the early symptoms of 
OCD, he was able to recognize such symptoms in his younger daughter, and
 get her the treatment he had been denied. <br />
Today, Mr Dahlberg lives in 
Snohomish with his successful wife and daughters, who sing, ski race, 
and, although busy, have a lot of fun. <br />
