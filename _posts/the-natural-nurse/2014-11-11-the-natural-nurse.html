the country. <br />
Early in life he met a teacher in New Mexican who taught him about the Shoshoni way of life and their view of nature. <br />
He also studied plants while on Hopi and Navajo reservations. <br />
Adding to his studies of the west, he spent time in the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness Area as well as the Superstition Wilderness area in Arizona. <br />
Paul Strauss is the land steward of the United Plant Savers Botanical Sanctuary. <br />
A farmer, herbalist, and beekeeper, Paul emulates the life of the “Green Man.<br />
” From seed to harvest to product, he works intimately with the plants. <br />
The owner of Equinox Botanicals, a small herb business, Paul grows most of what is used in his products. <br />
He has lived on his farm for forty years. <br />
On today’s show, we will review Paul’s book, The Big Herbs: The Use and Abuse, Natural History and Identification of Major Tree and Shrub Species in the Midwest and Eastern US
