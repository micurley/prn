Dr. Eugene Zampieron, ND, MH, interviews Dr. Michael Lipelt, DDS, ND. Dr.
<!--more-->
Lipelt holds degrees in Dentistry, Dental Acupuncture and Naturopathic Medicine. <br />
He is the founder of  Stillpoint Family Health Services (SFHS), uses his own personal experience with healing, his connection with the land, and years of diverse training and experience in natural medicine to tailor a unique, personalized solution to support and assist  natural healing ability and to achieve the health goals of entire families. <br />
 Dr Lipelt was led on a path to natural medicine 30 years ago after hurting his back in a bike accident, and finding no cure or relief using conventional, allopathic medicine. <br />
The resulting chronic pain and restricted movement interfered with his job as a general dentist in Santa Rosa, CA and hampered his active lifestyle. <br />
Being a runner and athlete, he elected to forego surgery and started his own journey in natural medicine. <br />
His injury led him to study many natural medical systems, all with the common foundation of healthy diet and lifestyle. <br />
Healthy eating led to the study of sustainable agriculture and the creation of Stillpoint Permaculture Center (SPC) on his own five acres in SonomaCounty, CA. <br />
Dr Lipelt’s ongoing work in permaculture and study of Ecological Sustainable Medicine continues today, along with his focus on Biologic Dentistry. <br />
