title: 'Pandora’s Lunchbox: How Processed Food Took Over the American Meal'
---

Host Ellen Kamhi, PhD, RN, www.naturalnurse.com, interviews author Melanie Warner.
<!--more-->
Melanie is the author of Pandora’s Lunchbox: How Processed Food Took Over the American Meal, and is a freelance writer for various publications, including The New York Times, Fast Company, Fortune Magazine and CBSnews.com.<br />
   Processed food represents an entirely new way of eating for human beings. <br />
Our diets have changed more in the last 100 years than they have in the last 10,000, and so much of what we now eat is deeply out of synch with our biology. <br />
While the enormous amounts of technology applied to food over the last century have been a boon to manufacturing efficiency, product innovation and lowered food costs, most of it has been disastrous for our health. <br />
Melanie has spent the past fifteen years writing about business. <br />
