Eugene Zampieron, ND, MH, www.drznaturally.com and Ellen Kamhi, PhD, RN, www.naturalnurse.<br />
com discuss the peer review research paper they published in The JOURNAL OF RESTORATIVE MEDICINE, entitled Natural Support for Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disease. <br />
Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involve destruction of healthy cells by the body’s own defensive mechanism. <br />
If the immune system’s faux pas is not corrected, the attack can progress to the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. <br />
The mechanisms that cause the deregulation of the immune response are not entirely understood. <br />
It can be assumed that heavy metal toxicity, leaky gut syndrome, infectious bacteria and parasites, and nutritional imbalances can overburden the body’s immune system, thus deregulating immune signals and responses. <br />
Ongoing research investigates the mechanism by which these factors cause the immune system to attack the body’s own tissues. <br />
In this paper, we discuss natural therapies that can help regulate the immune system’s aggressive behavior without suppressing or altering its necessary defenses.
