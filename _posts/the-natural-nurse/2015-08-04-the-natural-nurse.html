Conventional medicine recommends the use of DMARD drugs, which may help but have a plethora of negative effects. <br />
Dr Z and The Natural Nurse will discuss modern theories of the causes of Autoimmune illness, linked to dysregulation of the immune system. <br />
They will also offer specific evidence based herbal remedies that have a high level of safety and efficacy to help modulate autoimmune disease, such as T Cell Balance, which features Rehmannia, Cordyceps and Rosemary. <br />
