The Truth About Beauty, “Breaking the Rules……Why Being a Health Rebel is Key to Achieving Successful<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Transformation”

Joining us today is Kat James, the award-winning author and renowned transformation expert of “The Truth About Beauty.<br />
” Before becoming the natural health world’s premiere beauty-oriented health expert, —and, before that, one of the most quoted celebrity makeup experts of the nineties—Kat had a far deeper transformation that involved overcoming a 12-year, heroin-like addiction to food and a slew of other serious diseases. <br />
After healing herself of one issue after the other while dropping ten dress sizes and dramatically transforming her skin in the process, Kat spent nearly a decade gathering the science to validate the unusual approach she pieced together for her own health &amp; vitality. <br />
Since then, she’s gone on to help thousands dramatically transform their lives and their looks as she did through her bestselling book, her national health columns, talk radio show, PBS special, and her acclaimed Total Transformation programs. <br />
