Ellen Kamhi, PhD RN AHG AHN-BC, www.Naturalnurse.com, interviews Dr.
<!--more-->
 Alexis Hugelmeyer.<br />
  Dr Hugelmeyer is the  Medical Director and  Osteopathic Family Physician at The Suah Center for Natural Healthcare in Riverhead , NY. <br />
Dr Alexis is the daughter of a critical care physician and a special education teacher. <br />
 She attended undergraduate school at Villanova University, where she studied Comprehensive Science/Pre-Med and Bioethics, and attended medical school at New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old Westbury, with an emphasis in  Family Medicine. <br />
Dr Alexis focuses on an ‘old- fashioned’ medical model, as a full spectrum family physician who can treat most medical and physical conditions, and see any person of any age, thereby developing lifelong relationships in the process. <br />
This model of medicine is  reminiscent of the past when doctors spent time with patients –  listening to and taking care of every aspect of their lives, not just writing prescriptions for 40+ patients a day. <br />
Dr Hugelmeyer is  Board-Certified in Family Medicine and Osteopathic Manipulation, and has served as both a  hospitalist and in outpatient primary care. <br />
She has  been deeply involved in developing the Family Medicine and Internship training programs at Peconic Bay Medical Center, and served as the Administrative Director of Medical Education and Director of Traditional Rotating Internship and community wellness. <br />
The SUAH Center for Natural Healthcare brings together the advanced training and practice methods that Dr Hugelmeyer has studied, along with integrating best medical practices of conventional as well as complimentary and integrative medicine to offer patients a choice and voice in their own healthcare. <br />
