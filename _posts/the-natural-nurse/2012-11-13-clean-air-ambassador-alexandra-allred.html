Alexandra is a former US Olympic bobsledder, and the first woman in the history of the sport to be named US National Champion and Athlete of the Year by the US Olympic Committee, while pregnant.<br />
  Allred has been featured on ESPN, HBO Sports, Sports Illustrated, and countless book, magazine and newspaper profiles. <br />
An accomplished author, Allred is a wife and mother of four. <br />
DAMAGED GOODS is a story about the struggles of a family caught in the environmental and political quagmire of living in an extremely ‘toxic town.’ In 2005, Allred was instrumental in bringing Erin Brokovich to her hometown of Midlothian, Texas, the “Cement Capital of Texas.” Allred joined the environmental group, Downwinders at Risk, testified before the EPA and members of the US Senate and the House of Representatives.<br />
, traveling frequently to WashingtonDC She also joined forces with Earthjustice. <br />
In 2008 USA Today released new findings: the elementary school that Allred’s child attended was named in the upper one percentile of the most toxic elementary schools in the United States! <br />
Still, there is no action to change the situation. <br />
Today Allred routinely travels to Washington, DC to meet with Senators, speak before the United States Environmental Protection Agency and lobby on the Hill. <br />
