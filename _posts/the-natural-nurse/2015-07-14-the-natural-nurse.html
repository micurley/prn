He is a visiting professor at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Scottsdale, Arizona, School of Pharmacy University of Washington and Des Moines University Iowa. <br />
Dr Sodhi has been featured on radio and television programs across the country, and presents at conferences internationally. <br />
Dr Sodhi sits on the Panel of Experts with Dr Andrew Wile for Natural Health Magazine, is a featured expert in Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide, and is featured in The Textbook of Natural Medicine . <br />
He has also written for many other publications. <br />
He is currently busy attending to patients from all over the world at the Ayurvedic Naturopathic Medical Clinic in Bellevue, Washington . <br />
He envisioned Ayush Herbs along with his three brothers, which has become an international company. <br />
