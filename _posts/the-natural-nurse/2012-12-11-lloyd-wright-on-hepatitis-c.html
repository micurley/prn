title: Lloyd Wright on Hepatitis C
---
Host Eugene Zampieron, ND, MH, www.drznaturally.com interviews Mr. Lloyd Wright.
<!--more-->
Lloyd Wright attended UCLA for undergraduate work and continued his formal education at CalLutheranUniversity majoring in Administration of Justice.
<br />
Lloyd’s background in Natural Medicine began early in life, as his mother was “the Health Food Fanatic” of the 1950’s. <br />
Lloyd’s longstanding interest in Natural Medicine was further fueled as nearly everyone in his family has had cancer and most have died from it. <br />
Lloyd contracted Hepatitis C in 1979 from four blood transfusions and a liver biopsy in 1994 revealed Chronic Hepatitis C. <br />
After a bout with cancer and the conventional treatments Lloyd went through for his cancer therapy, Lloyd’s liver was in bad shape. <br />
The medical establishment advised Lloyd to get his papers in order and expect to live another 3 to 5 years, and hope something would come along to help.<br />
 Standing up against a legion of medical doctors who insisted Interferon was the only way, he researched the disease and proved them wrong. <br />
Through extensive research, and his studies with the highly regarded Dr John Finnegan, ND, Lloyd created a combination of herbal and glandular remedies that cured him completely of Hepatitis C. <br />
Lloyd authored the international best seller Triumph Over Hepatitis C, and discusses his new book,
Hepatitis C: A Do-It Yourself Guide for Health, on today’s show. Contact: http://www.hepatitiscfree.com<br />
