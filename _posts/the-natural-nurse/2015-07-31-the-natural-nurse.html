<!--more-->
Kaitlyn Staal. <br />
Known warmly as “Dr Kat,” she received her Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine and is a recent Summa Cum Laude graduate from the University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine. <br />
Dr Kat is currently completing her degree of Masters in Acupuncture, and completed further medical studies at Stony Brook University. <br />
Dr Kat is passionate about biochemistry, neurobiology, psychology, nutrition, and energy work. <br />
She does not see a disconnect between science and spirit-based medicine; rather, she views them as being on the same spectrum in human health. <br />
Dr Kat focuses on both the physical and mental aspects of her patients; she believes that one without the other is an incomplete picture of a patient’s total health. <br />
Dr Kat is currently seeing clients in Pawcatuck, CT and New Haven, CT. <br />
On today’s show, Dr Kat will discuss the oral microbiome and long-term health. <br />
