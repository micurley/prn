After a decade working as a conventional OB/GYN, Dr Jen realized she wanted more—for her patients and herself. <br />
She spent additional years becoming board certified in regenerative medicine, with an emphasis on bio-identical hormones and nutrition. <br />
She specializes in helping women and men restore their energy, their sex lives and improve health and lifestyle issues related to weight management, nutrition and exercise. <br />
Dr Jen often prescribes nutritional supplements and bio-identical hormones, as well as teaching her patients how to embrace a new sexual paradigm. <br />
Dr Jen is the Chief Medical Officer of BodyLogicMD . <br />
On today’s show Dr Landa discusses her inspiring book, The Sex Drive Solution, where she outlines the what, the why and the how of losing libido and shares some creative ways to get it back. <br />
