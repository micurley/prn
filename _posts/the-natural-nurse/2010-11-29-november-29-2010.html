<!--more-->
Wendell Potter is a senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity, the senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy, a highlighted contributor for the Huffington Post, and a leading critic of the health insurance industry. <br />
After a thirty-year career in public relations, he left his job as a corporate PR executive to speak out against what he had seen and been a part of during his years in the health insurance industry. <br />
Since he walked away as head of communications at a top health insurance company in May of 2008, he has worked tirelessly as an outspoken critic of corporate PR and the distortion and fear manufactured by America’s health insurance industry. <br />
It is a PR juggernaut that is bankrolled by millions of dollars, rivaling lobbying budgets and underwriting many “non-partisan” and “grassroots” organizations. <br />
Wendell has appeared on countless television and radio programs and been quoted in newspapers and magazines around the world. <br />
Time magazine wrote that Potter “may be the ideal whistleblower.” Today, we will discuss Wendell Potter’s new book, DEADLY SPIN
