Christine Horner, MD is a nationally known surgeon, professional speaker and author of  Waking the Warrior Goddess: Dr Christine Horner’s Program to Protect Against and Fight Breast Cancer– She holds two board certifications: the National Board of Surgery, and the National Board of Plastic Surgery. <br />
Dr Horner was recognized as a leader in her field shortly after starting her plastic and reconstructive surgery practice because she successfully ran a national campaign to pass laws requiring insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction surgery following mastectomy.<br />
  Her campaign involved several meetings with President Clinton and other political figures. <br />
On today’s show, Dr Horner discusses the safety and efficacy of  mammography and other screening tests. <br />
Does mammography do more harm than good? <br />
