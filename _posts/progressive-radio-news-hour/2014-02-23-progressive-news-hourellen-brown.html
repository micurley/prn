Ellen Brown
Brown is a civil litigation attorney, distinguished author, and frequent writer on financial issues.
<!--more-->

She heads the Public Banking Institute (PBI). <br />
It’s an initiative to return money power to the people where it belongs.
<br />
Her new book is an invaluable “Web of Debt” sequel. <br />
It comes at a critical time. <br />
It’s titled “The Public Bank Solution: From Austerity to Prosperity.<br />
”
Privatized money control assures speculation, booms, busts, inflation, deflation, instability, crises, recessions, depressions, deprivation and despair.
<br />
Public banks work as intended. <br />
Inflation-free prosperity follows. <br />
It’s a “practical, proven approach.<br />
” It works the same way everywhere. <br />

It’s the antidote to corrupted, dysfunctional privatized banking.<br />
