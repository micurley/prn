McKinney twice lost her congressional seat for supporting Palestinian rights, socially progressive policies and peace.
<br />

In 2008, she was the Green Party presidential candidate. <br />
Imagine America with her at the helm heading a supportive Congress. <br />
Instead of permanent wars and homeland repression, weâ€™d have model society peace, equity and justice.
<br />

Major world and national issues will be discussed.
