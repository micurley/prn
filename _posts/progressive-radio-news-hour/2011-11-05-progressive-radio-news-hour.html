Guest:  Kevin Barrett
Barrett is a scholar, university lecturer, and author.
<!--more-->
His book titled “Questioning the War on Terror” rips apart conventional views. <br />
It exposes motives behind it. <br />
They’re sinister ones to engender fear, wage imperial wars, and impose draconian homeland repression.
<br />
Major world and national issues will be discussed.
