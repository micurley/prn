Doing the right thing is costly.
<!--more-->
McKinney twice lost her congressional seat for supporting Palestinian rights, socially progressive policies and peace.
<br />
In 2008, she was the Green Party presidential candidate. <br />
Imagine America with her at the helm with a supportive Congress. <br />
Instead of permanent wars and homeland repression, we’d have model society peace, equity and justice.
<br />
McKinney edited and contributed to a new book titled, “The Illegal War on Libya.<br />
” It’s a must read to understand why Washington planned and led NATO’s war.
<br />
Discussion will focus on the book.<br />
