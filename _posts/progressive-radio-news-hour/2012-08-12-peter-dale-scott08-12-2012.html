He’s also a critic of US imperial policies.
<br />
He coined the phrase “deep politics.” He defines it as follows:
It “posits that in every culture and society there are facts which tend to be suppressed, because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so.<br />
”
They include covert criminal policies, unaccountable lawlessness, disturbing truths like 9/11, and today’s troubling environment.

Major world and national issues will be discussed.<br />
