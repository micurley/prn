Guest: Ellen Brown
Brown is a civil litigation attorney, distinguished author, and frequent writer on financial issues.
<!--more-->
A new edition of her important book, “Web of Debt,” is a brilliant analysis of the private banking system, how it usurped money creation power, and how we can get it back.
<br />
She also heads the Public Banking Institute (PBI), an initiative to return power to the people where it belongs.
<br />
Her latest writing will be discussed.
