Stephen Zarlenga is Director of the American Monetary Institute (AMI), a publicly supported charity involved in<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

conducting research on the nature of money, its role in controlling societies, and the importance of reforming a broken system to achieve economic justice.
<br />
Zarlenga is a noted expert on issues related to finance, securities, insurance, mutual funds, real estate, and futures trading. <br />
He’s written 20 books on money, banking, politics and philosophy, including “The Lost Science of Money” that “exposes the mythology created to protect those who are embezzling from society” by contolling the nation’s money.
<br />
The result is a structurally corrupted political economy with elected officials the handmaidens of Wall Street, aunprecedented wealth disparity between the rich and most others, and a society in decay heading for ruin and tyranny unless stopped. <br />

That topic will be discussed and Zarlenga’s prescription for change.
