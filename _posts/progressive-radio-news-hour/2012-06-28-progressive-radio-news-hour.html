Laila Yaghi
Laila is US political prisoner Ziyad Yaghi’s mother.
<!--more-->
We met in Chicago and discussed Ziyad firsthand.
<br />
Like many other persecuted US Muslims, he was wrongfully charged, convicted and imprisoned despite having committed no crimes.
<br />
Nonetheless, he’s serving 30 years in prison during the prime of his life. <br />
Laila does all she can to help him. <br />
She maintains the
Free Zihad Yaghi site. <br />
Visit it for regular updates.
<br />
Discussion will focus on this great injustice. <br />
It’s the wrong time to be Muslim in America. <br />
Many others suffer like Ziyad.
