It inspired her to become an ACLU court watcher throughout Dr Rafil Dhafir’s entire 17 week 2004-05 trial. <br />
It was rigged to convict.
<br />
Rafil is a true humanitarian. <br />
Nonetheless, he was convicted on 59 of 60 bogus counts. <br />
He was sentenced to 22 years in prison for being Muslim at the wrong time in America.
<br />
That topic, the latest information on Dhafir’s status, and persecuting Muslims in America will be discussed.
