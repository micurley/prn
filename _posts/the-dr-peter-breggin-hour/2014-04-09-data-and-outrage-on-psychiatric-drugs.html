abusive psychiatric drug practices involving our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as afterward in the VA.  The drug companies found the ideal top-down market for their drugs: Get the army to give them to active duty combat soldiers–a mind-boggling 20% of them.  Unsupervised young men and women carry into combat 90-120 day supplies of all the most dangerous drugs: benzos like Xanax, stimulants like amphetamine; antidepressants like Paxil and Prozac; and antipsychotic drugs like the old Trilafon and the new Seroquel.  Hear an in depth expose and examination of the Psychopharmaceutical Complex at its worst and the irresponsible psychiatrists who so eagerly enforce it.  A tour de force of psychiatry at its worst.
