Guest: Dr.

Bart Billings, PhD
My guest is Bart Billings, PhD.  I call him “The Conscience of Military Psychology and Psychiatry.”  Learn how psychiatric drugs are inundating the military with soldiers on dangerous missions overdosed on meds. Bart describes approaches that really help soldiers before and after combat to deal with their normal and inevitable reactions to wartime trauma.<br />
