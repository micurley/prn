years of psychiatric drugs? <br />
Mary Maddock is the author of Soul Survivor: A Personal Encounter with Psychiatry and a leader in the Irish psychiatric reform movement. <br />
 I first met Mary several years ago in Ireland at one of the largest psychiatric reform conferences that I’ve ever participated in. <br />
Mary’s story of personal triumph will inspire you to seek your own self-directed, self-defined road to psychological and spiritual freedom. <br />
Meanwhile, sign up soon at empathictherapy.<br />
org for our April 8-10 Empathic Therapy Conference in Syracuse, NY.
