A first in history!
<!--more-->
 Listen to two very experienced psychiatrists spend a whole hour talking about how dangerous it is to take psychiatric drugs and how hazardous it can be to withdraw from them. <br />
 My guest is psychiatrist Stuart Shipko, MD from Pasadena, California. <br />
 My wife Ginger calls this show “spectacular.”
