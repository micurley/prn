Dr.
<!--more-->
Breggin begins by describing his basic critique of psychiatric drugs and then is joined by psychiatrist Alberto Fergusson, MD, from Columbia, South America.<br />
  Dr Fergusson’s program helps homeless individuals who have been labeled “schizophrenic” with drug-free therapy by teaching them to take charge of their own recovery through accompanied self-rehabilitation.
