If you think psychotherapy is only for those with mild everyday problems, think again.
<!--more-->
This hour dives deeply into the essence of empathic therapy and finds that it the best therapeutic approach to anyone who suffers from emotional distress, including those with autism, psychosis and even serious traumatic brain injuries that render them nearly unable to communicate. <br />
My guest Richard Gottlieb, MSW, a therapist from Grand Rapids and Holland, Michigan, tells moving stories from his practice to show us how one human being can reach out to another in a healing manner. <br />
Along with dozens of others inspiring therapists and scientists, Richard will present at our upcoming Empathic Therapy Conference in Syracuse, New York, April 8-10, 2011. <br />
Get all the information you need about the conference atwww.EmpathicTherapy.<br />
org. <br />
Professionals and the public alike are welcome! <br />
See you there.
