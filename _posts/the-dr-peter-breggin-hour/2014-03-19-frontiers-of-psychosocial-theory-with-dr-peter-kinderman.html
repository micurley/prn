My guest Dr.
<!--more-->
Peter Kinderman heads a large Institute of Psychology, Health and Society in Great Britain, and gives us a window on the advances being made in GB compared to the US in mental health services.<br />
  He also provides wisdom and insight into the frontiers of psychosocial theory and practice, including the origins of emotional disturbance. <br />
A very thoughtful and educational hour. <br />
