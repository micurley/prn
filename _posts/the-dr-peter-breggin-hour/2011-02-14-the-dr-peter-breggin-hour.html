One of my most inspiring shows!  On this Valentine’s Day, I share thoughts about love with my dear friend, Dr.
<!--more-->
Adrianne Johnson–love in marriage and in every other aspect of life including therapy and the workplace. <br />
 And we disclose a lot about ourselves along the way. <br />
 What is love? <br />
 Is there love at first sight? <br />
 How to heal a broken marriage or friendship? <br />
 The difference between love and relationship? <br />
 How to overcome extreme loneliness? <br />
 Steps to take to find other people to love? <br />
We move back and forth between inspiring ideals and the details and practicalities of maintaining and growing a loving relationship. <br />
 And the first time ever, my wife Ginger surprises me by calling into the radio show to join us on the air. <br />
 I’ve always wanted her to do so, and now she does it as present to me on Valentine’s Day. <br />
 It’s a show about happiness and how to achieve it. <br />
  You can meet Adrianne, along with Ginger, at our upcoming Empathic Therapy conference (www.empathictherapy.<br />
org), April 8-10 in Syracuse.
