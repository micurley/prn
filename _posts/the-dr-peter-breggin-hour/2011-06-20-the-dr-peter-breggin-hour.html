If you come upon the unconscious victim of a car wreck who suddenly awakens in a panic, what should you do?

If you’re sitting beside a loved one or patient coming out of anesthesia and he or she becomes violent… or if your friend, parishioner or patient threatens suicide… how should you respond? <br />
What can any of us do if someone we care about starts acting very disturbed or “crazy” in our presence? <br />
My guest Doug Bower is well-qualified to talk about this with me. <br />
He’s a PhD counselor, an ordained Methodist minister and a registered nurse. <br />
We focus on how to handle emergencies without resort to psychiatric drugs.
