title: Tony’s Story
---

This is the most difficult and most heartfelt radio interview I have ever conducted.
<!--more-->
I talk with the surviving wife and the surviving mother of Tony Orban, an outstanding soldier and police officer driven to tragic violence and then to suicide by the antidepressant Zoloft (sertraline). As Tony’s medical expert I grew to know and to care about him and his family.<br />
 A poignant reminder of the human cost of violence induced by psychiatric drugs.
