Ryan, MD is a pediatrician so principled and honorable that once he realized it was wrong to psychiatrically diagnose and drug children he stopped doing it and instead began to provide children with what they need.   Dr Ryan is an inspiration and, if listened to, could spearhead a return to sound pediatric practice and save the quality of life of millions of children and future adults.   <br />
