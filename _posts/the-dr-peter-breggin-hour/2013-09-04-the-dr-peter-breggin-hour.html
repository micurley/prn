Frank Walton and I delve into our essentially social nature as Frank describes in very practical terms how we can help others, and ourselves, prosper through positive relationships.  We will both be presenting at Frank’s outstanding Adlerian Society of South Carolina annual conference in Mertle Beach the weekend of September 27-29, 2013.<br />
