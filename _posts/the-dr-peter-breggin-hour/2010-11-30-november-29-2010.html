Bregginâ€™s outstanding guest is Charles L Whitfield, MD, a physician, psychotherapist and expert both in addiction and in childhood trauma and abuse. <br />
 In private practice in Atlanta, Georgia, he is the author of the best-selling book Healing the Child Within and many others worth reading. <br />
Dr Whitfield delves deeply with Dr Breggin into the nature and impact of childhood abuse, the role of the 12 Steps in recovery, and the importance of ethics and spirituality in living a successful and rewarding life. <br />
 This hour should inspire anyone interested in therapy and personal growth.
