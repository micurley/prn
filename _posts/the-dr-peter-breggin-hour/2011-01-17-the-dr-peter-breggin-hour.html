Search the ends of the Earth for two of the world’s most caring, courageous, honest and intelligent psychiatrists, and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

you will find my two guests:  Doug Smith, MD from Juneau, Alaska, and Albert Fergusson, MD from Columbia, South America.  The show begins with Doug and I talking about the essence of good therapy and good personal relationships, and then about spirituality in therapy and life.  We are joined by Alberto who shares his view of the same common values.   All three of us treat patients who are labeled “schizophrenic” without medication, but with nuanced differences in our approaches.  You can also meet and hear both doctors at our Empathic Therapy Conference, April 8-10, 2011 in Syracuse, NY (www.empathictherapy.<br />
org).
