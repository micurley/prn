The Case: Correct Gross Miscarriage of Justice: Republicans and Democrats Unite for Former Governor Don Siegelman’s<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
 Clemency

Written into America’s genetic code is the proposition that the United States will always pursue democracy, right the wrongs, establish an environment of peace and justice for all. <br />
Today’s reading: this is pulp nonfiction.<br />
  The  current Vegas School of justice is gambling with a direct assault on America’s values, money system and our judicial past and future. <br />
It’s all done by sleight of hand, concealed by economic and legal double-speak.
<br />
To avoid the abyss towards which we are heading, Dana Speigleman, the daughter of former governor  Don Siegleman is launching a high-profile petition to reveal the deception of their predatory practices in order to reverse and legally overturn these policies.
<br />
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, former Governor of Alabama Don Siegleman  is now serving 6 years in a  Louisiana penitentiary  as a result of Karl Rove’s Machiavellian manipulation of politics and our judicial system. <br />
But, if truth were the final arbiter, then the roles would be reversed and Karl Rove would be in jail.<br />
 At the very least, Rove should be cited for reckless endangerment of the truth, in other words, perjury. <br />
With Rove, we pledge allegiance for injustice for all.<br />
