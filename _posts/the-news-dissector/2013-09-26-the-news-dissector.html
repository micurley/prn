CARTER ALAN. <br />
FORMER WBCN DJ AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK RADIO FREE BOSTON—ON WBCN ON THE RISE AND FALL OF WBCN (AND ROCK RADIO).
<br />
Blaring the Cream anthem “I Feel Free,” WBCN went on the air in March 1968 as an experiment in free-form rock on the fledgling FM radio band. <br />
It broadcast its final song, Pink Floyd’s “Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” in August 2009. <br />
In between, WBCN became the musical, cultural, and political voice of the young people of Boston and New England, sustaining a vibrant local music scene that launched such artists as the J. <br />
Geils Band, Aerosmith, James Taylor, Boston, the Cars, and the Dropkick Murphys, as well as paving the way for Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, U2, and many others. <br />
Along the way, WBCN both pioneered and defined progressive rock radio, the dominant format for a generation of listeners. <br />
Brilliantly told by Carter Alan–and featuring the voices of station insiders and the artists they loved–Radio Free Boston is the story of a city; of artistic freedom, of music and politics and identity; and of the cultural, technological, and financial forces that killed rock radio.
