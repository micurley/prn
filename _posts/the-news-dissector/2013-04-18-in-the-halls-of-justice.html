One reporter had the scoop on the day after the 2012 election, when the lawyer for Bradley Manning, the young Army<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
private accused of leaking more than 500,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks, stood up in the courtroom and announced that Manning would be taking responsibility for providing some of the documents.
<br />
“This was an incredible development in the court-martial,” recalls Kevin Gosztola, an independent journalist covering the hearings for the websiteFiredoglake. <br />
With no mainstream reporter in attendance, suddenly, Gosztola was being called upon and linked to by news organizations all over the world, including FRONTLINE.
<br />
“That’s when I realized that I, as a more independent journalist, had a critical role to play,” he says.
<br />
Weeks later, on the two days Manning himself took the stand to testify about his treatment in military prison, more news organizations were represented, but most left shortly afterwards. <br />
Critics turned up the heat on news organizations for not paying closer attention to the hearings.<br />
  The New York Times own ombudsman took the paper to account.
<br />
Gosztola is reluctant to beat up on the established news organizations — he says he recognizes many are strapped for resources these days — but still thinks the lack of coverage overall has been “shameful.”
He doesn’t let other independent journalists off the hook though.<br />
  “We’re missing established journalists, but we’re missing independent journalists” Gosztola says. <br />
“We’re missing other journalists from organizations based in the DC area who could be covering this story. <br />
 I don’t understand why there aren’t more journalists covering these proceedings.<br />
”
The military justice system is not always easy to report on. <br />
There’s no rule that requires the military to make it easy for court reporters, and the amount of access can vary wildly.<br />
  In the Manning proceedings, the government does not provide access to court filings, motions, or transcripts. <br />
In this regard, the military commissions at Guantanamo are a model of transparency in comparison.
