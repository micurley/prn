Never ending Story of Radioactive Lies, Backroom Deals and Toxic Contamination   Residents of San Francisco,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
California’s Treasure Island have been lured into a radioactive web of lies, backroom deals and a toxic legacy that never ends … But the City’s realtors, developers and politicians have invested big bucks in the island’s development — and they’re not about to let a little asbestos, dioxin, or even radioactivity stand in the way of their potential real estate bonanza. <br />
  That’s why, tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest continues her MEET THE BEAST series with US Navy veteran/ex-Treasure Island, California resident Jim Burres and resident whistleblower Kathryn Lundgren, founder of the Treasure Island Health Network, to continue unravelling the radioactive web of secrecy and lies in which so many of the island’s residents find themselves trapped.
