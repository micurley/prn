On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest presents MEET THE BEAST, Part Four: FRACKING BEAST MEETS KEYSTONE<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
XL. 

Sandy is joined in this endeavor by DeSmogBlog’s Steve Horn. 

They discuss TransCanada’s recently proposed ANR oil pipeline, and Steve Horn’s recent article at DeSmog Blog (www.desmogblog.com), titled, “ANR Pipeline: Introducing TransCanada’s Keystone XL for Fracking.<br />
”

They also discuss the broader connections (and “unharmonic convergences”), connecting the dots between hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and oil pipelines like Keystone XL — and how these converge in not-so-subtle ways with nuclear and military interests.
