Today, we’re talking with Allan Lichtman, Professor of History, about his latest book, co-authored with Professor Richard Breitman, called “FDR and the Jews,” a topic which generates spirited debate, even today.<br />
  The issue of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s response to the Nazi persecution and slaughter of Jews remains controversial and important. <br />
 Professor Lichtman explains that while FDR did not do everything possible for the Jews, he was far better for the Jews than his political opposition at home, or any other world leader of his time. <br />
 You can find, “FDR and the Jews,” on Amazon.
<br />

Allan Lichtman is a distinguished professor of history at American University in Washington, DC.  He is the author of 9 books, including “The Keys to the White House,” a system for predicting presidential elections, that has correctly predicted the presidential election, in every election since the system was developed in 1984.<br />
  Allan Lichtman also wrote, “White Protestant Nation:  The Rise of the American Conservative Movement,” a finalist for the national book critic circle award. <br />
 He has appeared as a political commentator on virtually every major media outlet in the US and worldwide.<br />
