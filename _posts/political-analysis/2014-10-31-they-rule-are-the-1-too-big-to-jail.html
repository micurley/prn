<!--more-->
of Law and author of the new book, “Too Big to Jail: How Prosecutors Compromise with Corporations.” They discussed what he means by “too big to jail,” how the heck corporations and executives got “too big to jail” to begin with, why lack of corporate accountability matters, the online research database he created as an appendix of sorts for his book on corporate crimes and lack of federal prosecutions and if he thinks tort lawsuits and private litigation can act as a remedy to lack of US government prosecution of corporation, among other related issues.<br />
 For the last 20 minutes of the show, Steve talked with Paul Street, an independent journalist, policy adviser, and historian. <br />
He is author of the new book “They Rule: The 1% vs. <br />
Democracy,” and also authored the books, “Crashing the Tea Party” and “The Empire’s New Clothes.<br />
” They discussed what he means by “they rule” and also went into depth on some of the contents found within the book including financialization, the deep state and solutions to shifting the balance of power away from the 1%.
