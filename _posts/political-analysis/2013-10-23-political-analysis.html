Tonight,
<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Political Analysis host Sandy LeonVest puts her head together with 
disaster-preparedness adviser and human rights activist Chuck McCune and
 nuclear power oracle Michael Mariotte to unravel the web of nuclear 
lies, corruption and criminality that plagues the nuclear industry. <br />
They
 discuss Fukushima, the lack of preparedness in the US for a nuclear 
accident, reactor deficiencies — and the industry’s relationship with 
US officials and representatives.
<br />

Michael Mariotte is the executive director of the 
Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS). <br />
You can learn more 
about him, or almost anything to do with nuclear power (esp safety and 
security issues) at www.nirs.<br />
org

Chuck McCune is a longtime human rights advocate and
 a disaster preparedness expert. <br />
He has advised numerous federal 
agencies, including FEMA, DHS and others. <br />
He is the founder of the Prizm
 Foundation (www.prizm.org), which helps communities — esp low income communitites — prepare for natural and not-so-natural disasters.<br />
