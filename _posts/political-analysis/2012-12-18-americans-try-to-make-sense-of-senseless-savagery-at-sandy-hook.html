Guest: Author, activist and teacher Randall Amster

On tonight’s Political Analysis, as the corporate media talks about<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Americans “trying to make sense” of a senseless mass killing, Sandy LeonVest is joined by author, teacher and peace activist Dr Randall Amster to take a deeper look at the December 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school. <br />
They explore a number of issues surrounding the tragedy that are not being addressed in the corporate news media. <br />
Among them: whether our current militaristic, consumer culture is making us sick — and/or contributing to the (literal) “dis-integration” of our most vulnerable young people; the concept of “cognitive dissonance” (anxiety resulting from holding contradictory or incompatible attitudes, beliefs, or standards) and whether the deep disconnect between how parents, teachers and political leaders tell young people to behave, and how they themselves behave is feeding the current epidemic of depression, suicide, bullying and PTSD in young people. <br />
They discuss the ways in which our culture of 24-7 images — via computers, television, video games and other hi-tech toys and gadgets — impact vulnerable young people in ways they (and the adults around them) often fail to see.
<br />

Randall Amster has worked as an attorney, judicial clerk, professor, and academic administrator during his professional career. <br />
He currently serves as chair of the Master’s program in Humanities at Prescott College in Arizona, as well as the Executive Director of the Peace &amp; Justice Studies Association. <br />
His work on homelessness and public space has garnered him widespread respect from his peers, and his two books, the most recent of which is Lost in Space: The Criminalization, Globalization, and Urban Ecology of Homelessness (LFB Scholarly, 2008), have earned him critical acclaim. <br />
His most recent article, “Save the Children,” is both a scathing indictment of American culture and a moving tribute to the 20 children and 8 adults who perished in the December 14th massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school. <br />
