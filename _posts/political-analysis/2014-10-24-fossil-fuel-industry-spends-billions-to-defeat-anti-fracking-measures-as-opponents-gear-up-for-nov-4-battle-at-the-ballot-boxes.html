Sandy and Steve are joined for the first half-hour byJoel Dyer, editor at the Boulder Weekly, an alternative online<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

publication out of Boluder, CO. <br />
They talk to him about fracking politics, and why the fracking battle in Colorado is both illustrative of the bigger fracking battle and key to winning the “fracking war.<br />
” They also talk about Joel Dyer’s recent piece (co-authored with Matt Cortina and Elizabeth Miller), titled, “Who Killed the Vote on Fracking? <br />
— Why Colorado’s anti-fracking measures were not supported by Democrats and environmental groups.<br />
” Dyer’s work has been published in a host of publications, including Vanity Fair and Mother Jones.
<br />

During the second half-hour, Steve and Sandy are joined by anti-fracking activist Carolyn Harding. <br />
Among other issues, they talk about why the “community rights-based” initiatives cropping up across the country are so important, and why the anti-fracking movement and the anti-nuclear movement are a “natural alliance.<br />
” Carolyn is a Columbus, Ohio-based grassroots activist working to pass a Community Bill of Rights there, with the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). <br />
The initiative would ban fracking waste injection within city limits, on the basis that safe air, water and food are a human (or community) right. <br />
She also works with Radioactive Waste Alert, a grassroots group in Columbus.
