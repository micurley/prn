In this “repeat performance,” Sandy LeonVest hosts a groundbreaking conversation on how the 99 percent can create a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

sustainable (and livable) future – even as the nation’s disemboweled “democracy” becomes less accessible to the “living majority.<br />
” Tonight’s guests, author and educator Gar Alperovitz and entrepreneur, organic farmer Bryan Welch have very different — but sometimes converging — ideas about how to create such a future.
<br />

Bryan Welch is the publisher of the highly successful Mother Earth News, Utne Reader and other publications, and one of the nation’s leading thinkers on what some have dubbed the “new capitalism.<br />
” His vision of a more just and sustainable world proposes a capitalism that distributes value according to the durability, provenance and sustainability of products — by paying attention to every consequence of a company’s operation.
<br />

Gar Alperovitz is the Lionel R. <br />
Bauman Professor of Political Economy at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative. <br />
Among his most recent books are America Beyond Capitalism and (with Lew Daly) Unjust Deserts: How the Rich Are Taking Our Common Inheritance and Why We Should Take It Back. He believes — as conveyed by the title of one of his books — that we need to move beyond capitalism, in order to pave the way to a vibrant democracy with a sustainable economy that can satisfy human needs — not least of which is the need to control one’s work and life.<br />
