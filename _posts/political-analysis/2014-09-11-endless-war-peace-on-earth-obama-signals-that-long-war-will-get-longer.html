that history required of his predecessor after September 11, 2001,” President Barack Obama announced that the US would (in essence) re-up, revamp and reinvigorate what the world has come to know as the “war on terror.<br />
”  He made the announcement in a publicly televised speech, delivered on September 10, 2014. <br />
In it, the president declared that the US and its allies would “degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.” This Thursday, September 11, Sandy and Steve will be joined on PRN by investigative historian Allen Ruff to discuss the state of US foreign policy on this13th anniversary of 9/11 — and the significance (and implications) of a newly revived (and expanded) “war on terror.<br />
” Allen Ruff’s work has appeared in Z Magazine, Against the Current, TruthOut and Counterpunch. <br />
He hosts a weekly radio talk show on radio station WORT 89.<br />
9 FM in Madison, WI and is author of the books “We Called Each Other Comrade: Charles H. <br />
Kerr and Company, Radical Publishers” and “Forward! <br />
A History of Dane: The Capital County.”
