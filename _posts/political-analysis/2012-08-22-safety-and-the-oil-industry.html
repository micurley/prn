US Oil Refineries’ Ongoing History of Explosions, Fires, Spills, Leaks, Toxic Gas Releases and Lack of Accountability<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
— Ubiquitous And Getting Worse

On tonight’s Political Analysis, host Sandy LeonVest is joined by three members of the United Steelworkers (USW) — Kim Nibarger, health and safety oil expert for the USW, Jim Lefton, assistant director for USW’s District 13 and USW spokeswoman Lynne Hancock — for a look at the oil refinery industry from a workers’ — and community safety — perspective. <br />
They discuss the industry’s shocking record of safety violations, mismanagement, lack of accountability and what tonight’s guests call “criminal” behavior on the part of upper management and executives in a corrupt and arrogant culture, which routinely places profits above worker and community health and safety. <br />
