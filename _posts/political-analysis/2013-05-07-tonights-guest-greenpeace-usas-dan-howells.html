title: 'TONIGHT’S GUEST: GREENPEACE USA’s DAN HOWELLS'

Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest is joined by Greenpeace USA’s Deputy Campaign Director Dan Howells<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

to take a critical look at the current Arctic drilling craze, and Shell Oil’s recent decision to halt its exploratory drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. <br />
They also discuss Shell’s current efforts to criminalize dissent — and its use of the US judicial system to do it. <br />
The case against Greenpeace is being heard right now in California’s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
<br />

 
The question before the court is whether Shell has the right to preemptively shut down protests that the company deems would threaten its operations. <br />
In filing this injunction, Shell is attempting to deprive activists of their first amendment rights by preventing Greenpeace from protesting Shell’s drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.
<br />


 
 
Sandy and Dan look at the ways in which a decision by the court in Shell’s favor would take yet another sledgehammer to what remains of our increasingly frail democracy, and they discuss the chilling effect such a ruling would have on free speech and first amendment rights — which would be felt by activists of every stripe, all across the country. <br />
Dan Howells stresses that such a ruling would render it nearly impossible to prevent other corporations from taking the same preemptive action against anyone they view as a “threat” to their activities — for as long as that activity occurred.
