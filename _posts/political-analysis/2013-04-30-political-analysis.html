Karyn Strickler, of Climate Challenge Media, guest hosts for Sandy LeonVest.
<!--more-->
 Karyn talks with Distinguished Professor Gerald Markowitz from the City University of New York, about his article, co-authored with David Rosner, “Your Body is a Corporate Test Tube.” In the article they say, “A toxic dump used to be a superfund site or a nuclear waste disposal site.  Increasingly, however, we — each and every one of us — are toxic dumps and for us there’s no superfund around, no disposal plan in sight.<br />
” Learn about the chemical stew to which we are unwittingly and unwillingly exposed and the deadly, short and long-term impacts they are having on us all. <br />
