Tonight’s guests: Ben Davis Jr.
<!--more-->
and Food &amp; Water Watch’s Adam Scow
On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest is joined during the first half of the show by energy activist and visionary Ben Davis Jr. <br />
to talk about two separate energy-related initiatives he is proposing for the 2014 California state ballot. <br />
One (the California Nuclear Waste Act) would ban nuclear power until the waste problem is solved and the other (the California Electrical Utility District initiative) would create a public utility district in the state that would eventually replace California’s mega-utilities.
<br />
During the second half-hour, Food &amp; Water Watch’s Adam Scow joins Sandy to talk about the current California hydrofracking boom, the political corruption that facilitates and paves the way for Big Oil &amp; Gas companies — including Occidental Petroleum, Aera Energy (owned jointly by Shell Oil and Exxon), Venoco and others — to frack the Golden State with impunity. <br />
They wind up the hour talking about what must be done RIGHT NOW to stop them.
