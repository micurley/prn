Guest: Al Weinrub, author of “Community Power: Decentralized Renewable Energy in California”


Tonight on Political<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Analysis, Sandy LeonVest in conversation with energy democracy advocate and author Al Weinrub, whose groundbreaking book, “Community Power: Decentralized Renewable Energy in California” lays out in a concise and accessible way, the ways in which communities can begin NOW to implement local generation of renewables. <br />
Al Weinrub’s book is an excellent resource for anyone seeking to understand not only why, in an era of accelerated climate change, we need locally-generated renewable power, but exactly how we can begin building it. <br />



Al and Sandy also discuss the need for a REAL clean energy movement, as opposed to one that tweaks the 20th century energy paradigm, rather than rebuilding a 21st century energy model from the ground up. <br />
To illustrate this, they discus the US “Community Choice Aggregation” (CCA) movement, which, for the most part, is pursuing what’s known as the “procurement” (or corporate-owned) energy model. <br />
This model accomplishes its “clean energy goals” with “Renewable Energy Credits” and “clean power” generation far away from the point of use. <br />
They discuss how this approach to CCA serves only to greenwash the corporate agenda, while ignoring the needs of the communities CCA is supposed to serve. <br />
As an example, they talk about Marin County, California, where its new CCA (Marin Clean Energy) broke away from one mega-utility (PG&amp;E) only to procure its energy from a subsidiary of mega-polluting multinational oil company Shell Oil (Shell Energy North America). <br />
