As most of America remains transfixed by the upcoming presidential elections, Political Analysis host Sandy LeonVest<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
reminds listeners that there are other (possibly more critical) things going on in the world. <br />
Tonight’s show features excerpts from the film documentary Tar Sands Oil Extraction — The Dirty Truth, as well as clips from the current (and expanding) blockade of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline in Winnsboro, Texas. <br />
The program also features excerpts from Chris Hedges 2010 speech, “How Corporations Destroyed America,” in which Chris Hedges talks about the ravages of unlimited corporate power and how consumers have so internalized corporate values that we barely know who we are — or how to begin reclaiming ourselves. <br />


Background on TransCanada’s Keystone XL Oil Pipeline:

While opposition to the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline continues to grow, so too do the numbers of protesters. <br />
As Political Analysis went to air, some of those protesters were blockading the southern leg of the project in Winnsboro, Texas. <br />
On October 15, 2012, a standoff began at the construction site of TransCanada’s oil pipeline, which, if completed, will run dirty tar sands oil from the Canadian tar sands fields, and across the country to US refineries on the Gulf Coast. <br />
The protests, now entering their fourth week, have attracted not only environmental activists, but local Texas landowners who are working with the environmentalists to block the pipeline’s path.
<br />
Last we heard (October 15, 2012), TransCanada was standing their ground. <br />
But, so too were the protesters. <br />
This, despite the fact that protesting anything in these corporate-owned times is an increasingly difficult — and dangerous — act of patriotism. <br />
Activist Ron Seifert told DemocracyNow’s Amy Goodman that even reporters were being arrested, and that in at least one instance, a New York Times reporter was handcuffed and removed from private property (not owned by TransCanada) by TransCanada’s private security forces. <br />
