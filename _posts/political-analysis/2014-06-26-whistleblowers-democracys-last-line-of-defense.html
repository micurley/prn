Tonight, Sandy LeonVest is joined by Norman Solomon, founder of the Institute for Public Accuracy and co-founder of the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

just-launched whistleblowers resource, ExposeFacts.<br />
org, along with Treasure Island whistleblower Kathryn Lundgren. <br />
The three of them blow the whistle on crimes against democracy — and the criminals who perpetrate them. 

Norman Solomon is an internationally acclaimed political journalist, media critic, author of countless books — AND the original host of Political Analysis, before passing the torch to Sandy in 2009, when he decided to run for congress.<br />
 

Kathryn Lundgren has been a resident of Treasure Island (San Francisco), California for ten years. <br />
When every member of her family began experiencing symptoms of illness — all of them serious — she began researching the island’s history. <br />
In the process of “turning over stones,” she discovered that the former US Navy training base harbored a witches’ brew of toxic substances — including asbestos, mold AND radioactive waste. <br />
Her courageous and ongoing struggle to inform, protect and defend the health and welfare of her family — and her community — has pit Kathryn Lundgren against a “battery of beasts,” including Big Developers, the SF political establishment AND the US Navy.<br />
