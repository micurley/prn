title: CAN WHITE LIBERAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS   “GET OVER THEMSELVES”   IN THE INTEREST
    OF BUILDING DIVERSE COALITIONS AND CREATING RADICAL CHANGE?
---


Guests: Nikeeta Slade and Alex Lotorto

There’s a lot of talk right now about racism, sexism, classism, homophobia<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
and elitism within the environmental movement. <br />
But too many white liberals view the term “racist liberal” as an oxymoron.
<br />
Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest is joined by Nikeeta Slade and Alex Lotorto to kick off an ongoing series, in which all of these issues and more will be addressed. 
The conversation is the first of its kind, dealing with the critical but underplayed issue of racism in (and the “unbearable whiteness” of) the contemporary green movement — specifically the Big Greens and NGOs.<br />
 
Among other things, the program will look at the prickly (but all too real) issue of “liberal racism;” how environmentalists can go beyond PR, campaign slogans and tokenism to “reach out” to non-white communities; and how the current movement can begin strategizing for effective bridge-building. <br />
— ie: the ways in which environmentalists can begin building deep diversity and REAL coalitions with communities all over the world, including with indigenous people (whom, after all, were the FIRST radical environmentalists).
<br />
