title: THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS — Part One GLOBAL WATER SHORTAGE IS HERE NOW AND WITH
    DENIAL OFF THE HOOK, IT’S ABOUT TO GET MUCH WORSE
---
Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy Leon Vest and Steve Horn present part one of a series we are calling (exactly what<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
it is): THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS. <br />
Right now, the planet on which we all depend for our survival is at the precipice — quite literally, on the verge of a catastrophic water shortage. <br />
Worse still, what remains of the world’s water supply is rapidly being poisoned, polluted and contaminated with everything from industrial waste, fertilizers, fracking (and other) chemicals to radioactive waste and toxic algae. <br />
Sandy and Steve are joined by world-renowned Hydrologist and lecturer Dr James Famiglietti and journalist/activist Michael Leonardi to talk about the unequivocal urgency of preserving and conserving (what’s left of) our global water supply. <br />
