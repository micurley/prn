The third in a series of “Conversations for the 21st Century”
 
In recognition of May Day (International Workers Day)<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Sandy LeonVest pays tribute to workers all over the world during this third in a series of “Conversations for the 21st Century.<br />
” The participants in this conversation, David Swanson and Joshua Frank, are two of the nation’s most eloquent progressive advocates, as well as nationally acclaimed journalists, authors and activists. <br />

 
This week’s discussion takes place against the backdrop of deep social unrest — in the US and across the world — and as tens of thousands gather across the nation to demand decent jobs (with a living wage), human rights, healthcare for all, access to affordable education and the end of war. <br />
They discuss the significance of the Occupy movements’ May Day demonstrations and General Strike, in the context of the upcoming 2012 presidential elections, including a look at 21st century progressive politics and the importance of pushing for a truly progressive agenda and exercising our constitutionally guaranteed democratic rights outside of the “corporate ballot box.”    <br />
