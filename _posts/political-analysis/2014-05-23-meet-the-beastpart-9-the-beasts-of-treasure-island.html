Tonight on Political Analysis, host Sandy LeonVest presents The Beasts of Treasure Island.
<!--more-->
Treasure Island, California is a radioactive crime scene. <br />
And veteran San Francisco reporter, journalist and activist Carol Harvey has been covering the story for years — perhaps more thoroughly than any other reporter in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br />
She joins Sandy to talk about what’s really happening on the island — and to begin the process of unmasking and outing some of Treasure Island’s deadliest Beasts.
