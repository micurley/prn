Energy Democracy and Community-Owned Power — An Unpaved Road with an Uncertain Future

Guest: Actuary, energy analyst<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
and economist GailTverberg

“Energy Democracy” may be a concept whose time has come — and it’s certainly a bold vision for a livable future. <br />
But as our idealistic host Sandy LeonVest finds out from tonight’s guest, the road to energy democracy is sure to be a rough one — and there will be lots of pot holes along the way. <br />
Tonight SLV is is joined by energy analyst, actuary and economist Gail Tverberg to discuss the folly of infinite growth in a world of finite — and rapidly shrinking — resources. <br />
A concept whose time has come, the idea of a post-growth economy remains shrouded in suspicion and is dismissed with great disdain by the status quo and corporate classes, who fea
r that such an approach to REAL sustainability would end their world, as they have come to know it. <br />
And that fear is justified. <br />
But, while Ms.Tverberg comes at the issue of endless growth from the perspective of an economic and political “agnostic” (and essentially reaches many of the same conclusions about the “localization imperative” as those who advocate for local generation/energy democracy), she’s not nearly as optimistic about the future of localized energy generation as her host.<br />
