title: The State of America on the Birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
---
On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest observes the (real) birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
<!--more-->
with civil rights activist, journalist and author Kevin Alexander Gray. <br />
They listen to excerpts from (and discuss) some of Dr King’s lesser known, but equally important sermons, including “The Other America” and “Where Do We Go From Here?<br />
” They also discuss Dr King’s vision of “peace on earth,” and what he might say about the state of today’s world — from this nation’s seemingly neverending “war on terror” to the “economic terrorism” coming out of Washington — and the political and economic culture that is spawning it. <br />

Tonight, on Martin Luther King Jr.<br />
’s 84th birthday — 45 years after his untimely death — Political Analysis pays tribute to MLK’s vision and his message — one that is arguably more relevant today than it was when he was alive.

Kevin Alexander Gray is the author of the book, “Waiting for Lightening to Strilke: The Fundamentals of Black Politics.” His website is:  kevinalexandergray.com<br />
