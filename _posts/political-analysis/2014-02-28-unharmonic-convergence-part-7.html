title: UNHARMONIC CONVERGENCE — PART 7
---
On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest presents the seventh part of PRN’s ongoing series of programs, titled<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
“UNHARMONIC CONVERGENCE.<br />
” 

In this segment, Sandy looks at “Nuclear Power’s Deadly Legacy: Leaks, LIes and Lethal Waste,” exploring the unresolved — and seemingly unresolveable — issue of nuclear waste; the recent and ongoing “epidemic” of nuclear accidents, spills and leaks here in the US and across the globe and the shroud of secrecy that surrounds the nuclear industry and all of its activities.
<br />

Joining Sandy to discuss these and other nuclear issues, Beyond Nuclear Executive Director Kevin Kamps. <br />
Kevin Kamps is a Radioactive Waste Watchdog, specializing in nuclear waste transportation and management. <br />
Other topics discussed: A new report (Mobilizing Nuclear Bias) published in Japan Focus. <br />
The report reveals how the US and Japanese governments knew far more than they’ve admitted (to this day) about the radioactive contamination of sailors on the USS Ronald Reagan; a radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico; new leaks coming out of Fukushima Daiichi; and an important piece of nuclear waste legislation, known as the Nuclear Waste Administration Act (S 1240).
<br />

At the end of the show, they tell listeners how they can plug in to stop the “nuclear madness.<br />
”

Beyond Nuclear is a non-profit working to educate and activate the public about the connections between nuclear power and nuclear weapons and the need to abandon both to safeguard our future. <br />
Beyond Nuclear advocates for an energy future that is sustainable, benign and democratic.
