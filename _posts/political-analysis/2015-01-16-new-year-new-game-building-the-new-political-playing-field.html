On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest hosts a conversation about effective 21st century activism, featuring a veritable rock star lineup of activists.<br />
 
Sandy is joined by the magnificent Dr Margaret Flowers, activist and author Kevin Alexander Gray, attorney and activist Kevin Zeese and poet and political philospher/sattirist Phil Rockstroh to talk about organizing strategies for the 21st century, the pros and cons of social media (and “armchair activism”) and creating a sustainable, non-violent revolution.
