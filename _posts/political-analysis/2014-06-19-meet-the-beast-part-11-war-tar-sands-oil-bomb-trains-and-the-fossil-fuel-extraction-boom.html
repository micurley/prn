TONIGHT on Political Analysis, DeSmog Blog’s Steve Horn joins Sandy LeonVest for MEET THE BEAST — Part 11. 

They<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
discuss the escalating violence in Iraq, the connection between militarism and fossil fuel extraction — and the link between global turbulence, militarism and fossil fuels. <br />
They also discuss the current “extraction boom” here in the US and in Canada. <br />
  During the second half-hour, Steve Horn discusses the significance of the Obama Administration’s new carbon rules, and whether EPA’s new regulations will help mitigate accelerating climate change — or the fossil fuel industry’s “Damn the Torpedoes” approach to energy extraction. <br />
They wrap up the broadcast with a discussion of Steve Horn’s hot-off-the-press article, “Silent Coup: How Enbridge Is Quietly Cloning the Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline.”  Resources:  www.solartimesnow.org www.desmogblog.com<br />
