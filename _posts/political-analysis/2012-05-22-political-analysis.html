21, airing audio clips from veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who, after throwing away their medals, reveal how they feel NOW about the wars they served in. <br />
Next, Sandy brings on ex-financial industry executive Richard (RJ) Eskow. <br />
They talk about RJ’s recent piece in the Huffington Post, which critiques JP Morgan Chase’s latest scandal — a multi-billion dollar derivative transaction gone wildly awry, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. <br />
RJ also talks about the imperative of putting an end to Big Banks, if Americans are ever to see an end to massive financial corruption and reclaim our democracy — and the banking-war connection. <br />

 

Richard Eskow is a Senior Fellow with the Campaign for America’s Future and he hosts a radio program called “The Breakdown,” aired on We Act Radio in Washington DC. <br />
