title: Sustainable Capitalism” is an Oxymoron

Environmental activist and author Chris Williams joins Sandy LeonVest to talk about “eco-socialism,” the 2012 elections<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

and the need to eschew capitalism and transition to a new economic model in the interest of (real) sustainability. <br />
Williams argues that there is no such thing as “sustainable capitalism,” and that the ecological changes proposed by socialists are ultimately the most humane (and feasible) for building a society whose objective is human and natural sustainability.<br />
 Among other issues discussed are the reluctance of US climate activists and environmentalists to connect the dots between social injustices, war, work and the environment; the folly of unending growth in a world of finite resources; and the need to work in solidarity with indigenous people within the framework of an international movement to address growing economic disparities, unprecedented environmental destruction and social injustice.
<br />

Chris Williams is a long-time environmental activist, professor of physics and chemistry at Pace University and chair of the science department at Packer Collegiate Institute. <br />
His first book, “Ecology and Socialism: Solutions to Capitalist Ecological Crisis,” argues that there is “no such thing as sustainable capitalism.”
