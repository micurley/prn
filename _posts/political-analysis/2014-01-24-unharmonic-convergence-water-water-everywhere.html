WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE 


TONIGHT on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest hosts “Water, Water Everywhere” — the second<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
installment of PRN’s ongoing series, “Unharmonic Convergence“

Joining Sandy to kick off the hour, Food&amp;Water Watch’s Adam Scow, who talks about the “unharmonic convergence” taking place in California right now — how and why the Golden State’s “mega-drought” is unharmonically converging with a number of forces. <br />
Among them, hydrofracking, Governor Brown’s water-stealing Twin Tunnels project and his ties with Big Oil&amp;Gas — all against the backdrop of ever-accelerating climate change.
<br />

Later, West Virginia human rights activist, radio journalist and planet-defender Bob Kincaid, of Head-on Radio, joins Sandy to talk about West Virginia’s recent massive chemical spill, mountaintop removal and the connection between “environmental injustice” and increasing poverty and inequality worldwide.
<br />

***Soon to come on Political Analysis, an entire hour dedicated to how and why water privatization — an increasingly troubling phenomenon — is worsening what is already a criminal violation of human rights — and the rights of all living things — here in the US.
