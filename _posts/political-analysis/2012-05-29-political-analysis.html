Is War Inevitable?
<!--more-->
On this week’s Political Analysis, one day after the nation took a minute to pay tribute to its war dead with parades, speeches and too much drinking, Sandy LeonVest hosts a different kind of tribute with guest John Horgan, author of The End of War. <br />

An acclaimed science journalist, Horgan makes a research-based case that Americans’ belief in the inevitability of war is based on false assumptions and in some cases outright lies. <br />
He argues that the ancient institution we call “war” is not an inevitable outcome of human nature — and that killing one another is not embedded in our genes. <br />
