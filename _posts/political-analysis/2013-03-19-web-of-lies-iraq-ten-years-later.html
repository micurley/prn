Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest presents Web of Lies: Iraq Ten Years Later — a Political Analysis special<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
on the tenth anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq …
Ten years after the US-led invasion and near-total destruction of Iraq, Sandy LeonVest challenges the mythology of the US (or anyone else) having “won” that war, along with the cultural pathology that allowed — and continues to allow — the aberration we call “war” to continue. <br />
Using audio clips from both the pre-Iraq war buildup and the post-war devastation, Sandy examines the web of lies woven and spun by the GW Bush administration and its corporate media allies that led to the near-total destruction of a once-civilized and culturally advanced nation, and left hundreds of thousands of other lives — including US veterans and their families — in ruins. <br />
Audio highlights include excerpts from Arundhati Roy, David Swanson and Greg Palast, along with other key players in the Web of Lies known today as the Iraq War. <br />
