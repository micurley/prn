teacher/journalist Mickey Huff (Project Censored).
<br />
On tonight’s show, Sandy LeonVest and Steve Horn present Part One of their new series, headlined Pimp This Public School … 
During the course of the series, they feature a critical look at public schools, the privatization frenzy, corporate influence and the importance of literacy and quality education for ALL – what some call “universal education” — to a functional democracy. <br />
Joining Steve and Sandy are professor/essayist/author PL Thomas, college teacher and journalist Adam Bessie and Mickey Huff (Project Censored).
<br />
This conversation in the wake of President Obama’s much-heralded (and some would argue, overly-hyped) proposal to make community college tuition-free.
<br />
PL Thomas serves as Associate Professor of Education at Furman University, in Greenville SC … He’s also a prolific author and essayist. <br />
Among his many books, Ignoring poverty in the US.<br />
: The corporate takeover of public education and  Becoming and Being a Teacher: Confronting Traditional Norms to Create New Democratic Realities. <br />
 
Adam Bessie is a professor of English at Diablo Valley College – based in Northern California.<br />
 Adam has published essays on education, comics, media and culture in (among other publications) The Washington Post’s “Answer Sheet,” Daily Censored, the Project Censored book series and Truthout.
<br />
 Mickey Huff is a Professor of social science and history at Diablo Valley College … He serves as director of Project Censored, a Northern California-based non-profit, dedicated to educating students and the public about the importance of a free press for democratic self-government. <br />
Among other things, Project Censored exposes and opposes news censorship and promotes independent investigative journalism, media literacy, and critical thinking.
