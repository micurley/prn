removal (MTR) coal mining.  It’s called the Appalachian Community Health Emergency Act.<br />
  The ACHE Act, as it’s appropriately nicknamed, focuses on the need to protect people from what advocates call a growing, urgent health emergency – caused by mountaintop removal coal mining.
<br />
Today we have two super stars of the anti-mountaintop removal movement, a leader in the effort to pass the ACHE Act, and a professor who studies the disperate health impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining on the Appalachian people’s lives and health, with exponentially higher rates of birth defects, cancer, heart disease and death among those living near MTR sites.
<br />
Bo Webb’s work to end mountaintop removal coal mining has been called — fearless and inspiring.  In 2010 Webb, a grandfather, Vietnam veteran and coal miner’s son was the recipient of the prestigious Purpose Prize, recognizing social entrepreneurs over 60.  He is a member of Coal River Mountain Watch.<br />
  He is a co-founder of Mountain Justice Summer and was a lead organizer in Appalachia Rising Washington DC 2010.

Michael Hendryx - is Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy, Management, and Leadership in the School of Public Health at West Virginia University.<br />
  Dr Hendryx is also the Director of the West Virginia Rural Health Research Center, which conducts research on environmental health for rural populations.
