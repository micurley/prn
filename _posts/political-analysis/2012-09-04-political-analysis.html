Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest is joined by retired CAL OSHA Senior Public Health Official Dr.
<!--more-->
Larry Rose. <br />
A physician by profession, Dr Rose, also serves as an Occupational Environmental Medicine Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). <br />
Having recently joined the burgeoning national movement for energy democracy, Dr Rose is in the process of organizing a major grassroots effort in Marin County, California to get dirty energy — and the fossil fuel industry — out of California’s first Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), known as Marin Energy Authority (MEA) or Marin Clean Energy (MCE). <br />



Along with other CCA-related issues, SLV and Dr Rose discuss why California’s first CCA is so important to the nation’s “clean energy future;” how CCA is being subverted by Big Energy interests; how California’s first CCA in Marin County, (MEA) — with the help of its public relations arm (MCE)– managed to package and sell its corporate-controlled model to Marin residents and local environmental groups as “clean, local and non-corporate;” how the concept of “energy democracy” is being jeopardized and co-opted by the corporate-controlled version of CCA. <br />
They also discuss how Shell Oil, Con Edison and other fossil fuel interests embedded themselves in CCA — aided and abetted by the Marin-based LEAN EnergyUS, an organization dedicated to taking the corporate-owned model of CCA national.<br />
