Tonight, Political Analysis presents part two of its series on the Global Water Crisis … Joining Sandy and Steve for<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

the entire hour to talk about the global significance of Bolivia’s successful popular rebellion against water privatization — aka “water wars” — and what communities here in the US can learn from the struggle of the  Bolivian people, founder and director of the Democracy Center (in Cochabamba, Bolivia), Jim Schultz.<br />
 
Jim is the author of the acclaimed book, Dignity and Defiance: Stories From Bolivia’s Challenge to Globalization. <br />
The book has received rave reviews from, among others, author Naomi Klein, who wrote: 
“{Dignity and Defiance} forces the abstract and sanitized theory of globalization to get down and dirty in the real world: in the oil spills, the coca fields, the border crossings, the political massacres. <br />
This is the little-known story of a people that has dared to fight back against the most powerful economic forces on the planet, told by writers with the courage to dig relentlessly for the truth and the humility to stand back and let their subjects speak for themselves.Enraging, unsparing, inspiring.”
—Naomi Klein, author of The Shock Doctrine
Jim Schultz was the only American reporter to remain in Bolivia during the entire time of Cochabamba’s now-famous “water wars”
