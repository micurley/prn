fuel industry and the environment — including (but not limited to) a massive coal slurry spill at a plant owned by Patriot Coal in West Virginia, a gas well explosion at Chevron’s facility in Dilliner, Pennsylvania and another gas explosion in Tioga, North Dakota, Sandy LeonVest presents Part 5 of PRN’s series UNHARMONIC CONVERGENCE.

Alex Lotorto, a union delegate for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) talks to Sandy about the Blue-Green Alliance conference in Washington DC, which took place this week, as well as the current split among labor groups, with respect to the Keystone XL pipeline (KXL). <br />
He debunks the “jobs versus environment” myth, and discusses how labor and the climate change movement can coalesce in a way that promotes both decent-paying jobs and a livable planet. <br />
Later in the hour, the Global Labor Institute’s Dr Sean Sweeney joins the discussion to talk about his groundbreaking report: ““Pipe Dreams: Jobs Gained, Jobs Lost in the Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline”
 
Dr Sean Sweeney is the director of Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute and co-author of “Pipe Dreams: Jobs Gained, Jobs Lost in the Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline” <br />
