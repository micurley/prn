On this week’s Political Analysis: Can This Democracy Be Saved?
<!--more-->


Sandy LeonVest talks to pro-democracy activist, visionary and founder of Wisconsin’s Liberty Tree Foundation, Ben Manski. <br />
He discusses the significance of Governor Scott Walker’s successful effort to defeat the recent recall effort in that state; ongoing efforts in Florida and other states to purge the voter roles of non-GOP voters; and the evermore alarming trend of outright election-theft on the part of conservatives. <br />
Sandy and Ben also look at the ways in which unlimited corporate money is corrupting the electoral process — and what needs to happen (outside of the corporate-owned ballot box) in order for the people to reclaim what remains of our democracy here in the US.<br />
