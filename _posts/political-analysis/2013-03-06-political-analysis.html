PULLING THE PLUG ON FOSSIL FUELS AND NUCLEAR POWER



On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest talks during the<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
first half of the show about the global extent — and impact — of hydraulic fracturing (or fracking). <br />
The show features a speech by Friends of the Earth president Nnimmo Bassey, who talks about Shell Oil’s fracking in Ireland and the Niger Delta.
<br />

Later in the hour, Sandy is joined by Green Party member and anti-nuclear activist Joe DeMare. <br />
They talk about “Pull the Plug on Nuclear Power,” an event taking place on March 11, and that encourages people to observe the second anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster (which rendered an entire region of Japan, home to more than 200,000 people radioactively contaminated and uninhabitable) by “pulling the plug.<br />
” 


On March 11, thousands of people around the US the world will join together to teach the utility companies a lesson — that we do not need the utilities or nuclear power to survive. <br />
By using as little grid-supplied power as possible on that day, we will not only cost the utilities money, we will be declaring our independence from dirty, centralized, unsustainable generation technologies.
