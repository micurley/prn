Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest is joined by Michael Mariotte, president of NIRS (the Nuclear Information<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
&amp; Resource Service) for Part Five of her series, MEET THE BEAST. <br />
This week, Sandy introduces the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) — “the Beast that regulates the (nuclear) Beast.<br />
” 

MEET THE NRC introduces listeners to the five commissioners charged with protecting public health and safety — and regulating the nuclear industry. <br />
And, even if you’re not surprised to learn who is guarding the nuclear “hen house,” you will get an earful about exactly WHO and WHAT this particular Beast is protecting — and whose interests it is promoting.
