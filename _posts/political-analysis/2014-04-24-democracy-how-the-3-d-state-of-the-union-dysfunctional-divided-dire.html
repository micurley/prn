Two days after President Obama’s 2014 SOTU address, Sandy LeonVest hosts the third show in her ongoing series,<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Unharmonic Convergence.
<br />
 
DemocracyHOW? <br />
— The 3-D State of the Union: Dysfunctional, Divided, Dire features responses from the REAL America to President Obama’s SOTU address. <br />
Sandy includes excerpts from award-winning investigative journalist and filmmaker Jeremy Scahill, a group of black grassroots organizers from Chicago, and a speech delivered by Socialist Party organizer and Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant — on the same day as Obama’s SOTU.
<br />

Later in the hour, Sandy is joined by teacher, author, eco-socialist and environmental activist Chris Williams. <br />
Chris is author of the book, “Ecology and Socialism: Solutions to Capitalist Ecological Crisis.<br />
”
She’s also joined by author, journalist and civil rights activist Kevin Alexander Gray. <br />
Kevin is a community organizer in Columbia, South Carolina. <br />
He’s the author of the book, “Waiting for Lightning to Strike: The Fundamentals of Black Politics.<br />
” and a frequent contributor to progressive and Black American publications, among them Counterpunch, Black Agenda Report and Black News …
 
Kevin Alexander Gray is the former president of the south Carolina ACLU
 
The three discuss the ways in which the 2014 SOTU address failed to address the root of the problem that currently threatens to decimate what remains of our democracy, the American working (and middle) classes and the environment. <br />
They also discuss the ways in which this nation”s economic system (capitalism) has failed the vast majority of Americans. <br />
They talk the convergence of the environmental movement with the movement for racial equality, and how the US could — with a concerted, organized effort by The People — have it all — more (and better-paying. <br />
less-polluting) jobs, less climate change and less injustice. <br />
They talk about democratizing opportunity, wealth and energy, and about Obama and others’ attempts to create change within a broken and unsustainable system, versus REAL, systemic change, racial justice and “eco-socialism.”
