Costas Panayotakis, author of Remaking Scarcity
Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest looks at the current US budget crisis, with analysis of President Obama’s “Grand Bargain,” while offering some perspective on the “fiscal cliff” — and why going over it might be a better option than cutting a deal with Republicans. <br />
Later, Dr Costas Panayotakis, professor of Sociology at CUNY and author of the book, “Remaking Scarcity: Capitalism, Scarcity and Economic Democracy,” joins Sandy to talk about what Americans can learn from the worsening financial crisis in the Eurozone, and why austerity measures and cuts in social spending will only exacerbate and prolong our worsening financial crisis.<br />
