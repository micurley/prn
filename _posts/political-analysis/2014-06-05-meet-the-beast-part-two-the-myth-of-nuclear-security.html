title: 'MEET THE BEAST — PART TWO: THE MYTH OF “NUCLEAR SECURITY”'
---
Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest features Part two of her series, MEET THE BEAST.
<!--more-->
This week’s show – “The Myth of Nuclear Security.”  In the wake of the March 24, 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, Sandy LeonVest is joined by *PRIZM Foundation CEO/executive director and environmental/social justice activist Chuck McCune, to talk about the myth of “nuclear security.<br />
” Chuck McCune is a licensed contractor, an architecht and a sustainability expert. <br />
As an active member of the anti-nuclear community in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, he frequently lends his expertise at nuclear hearings, reporting and testifying on various nuclear safety issues, as well as the flaws and vulnerabilities of nuclear power. <br />
Most recently, Chuck McCune testified at the WIPP (radioactive leak) hearings. <br />
Chuck McCune is also a frequent witness at NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) hearings, as well as nuclear waste confidence hearings. <br />
*WIPP is the acronym for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the nuclear waste repository in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which made headlines on February 14, 2014, when it developed a radioactive leak. <br />
Both the cause and origin of the release remain unknown. <br />
The show also features audio clips from the PBS documentary “Is Nuclear Energy Safe? <br />
Nuclear Energy Risks and Consequences,” as well as excerpts from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders grilling NRC commissioners at a 2011 Senate hearing on the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. <br />
*The PRIZM Foundation is a sustainable community-oriented nonprofit in Albuquerque, New Mexico, working on global issues regarding converging potential disasters and environmental justice.
