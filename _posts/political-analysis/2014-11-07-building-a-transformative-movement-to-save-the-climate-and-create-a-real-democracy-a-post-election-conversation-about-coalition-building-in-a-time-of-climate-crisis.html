title: 'BUILDING A TRANSFORMATIVE MOVEMENT TO SAVE THE CLIMATE AND CREATE A REAL DEMOCRACY:   A
    POST-ELECTION CONVERSATION ABOUT COALITION-BUILDING IN A TIME OF CLIMATE CRISIS'
---
The Global Labor Institute’s Dr. Sean Sweeney joins Sandy LeonVest on tonighit’s Political Analysis.
<!--more-->
Sandy and Sean reflect on Tuesday’s election results and the ramifications for the climate. <br />
They also discuss Energy Democracy in an increasingly undemocratic world and this November’s Labor and Climate Justice Forum in NYC (moderated by  Dr Sweeney). <br />
Other topics include the folly of Obama’s “all of the above,” methane-powered climate plan; the imperative of organizing a mass, “transformative” movement — from the ground up; effective coalition building on a divided planet and current strategies for uniting various activist and grassroots groups, in the interest of saving the climate.
<br />
“With the threat of climate change and the likely breach of planetary resource limits, human civilization faces an energy emergency of global proportions.” (from the WorldwatchInstitute’s State of the World 2014: Governing for Sustainability, co-authored by Dr Sean Sweeney, co-director of the Global Labor Institute at Cornell University.<br />
) The book highlights the need for economic and political institutions to serve people and preserve and protect our common resources.
