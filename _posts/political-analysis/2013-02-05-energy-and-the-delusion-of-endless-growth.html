Tonight on Political Analysis, author, eco-activist and senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute (PCI) Richard<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Heinberg joins Sandy LeonVest to talk about, among other things, PCI’s new book, “Energy: Overdevelopment and the Delusion of Endless Growth.<br />
”
They discuss the folly of an economy whose very existence requires endless growth and ongoing environmental devastation on a planet of finite resources. <br />
They consider the ways in which people can begin to change the corporate-dominated energy narrative, and transform the obsolete economic model known as capitalism by creating a truly resilient economy — one grounded in creativity and imagination, as opposed to endless destruction.
<br />
During the course of the hour, Richard Heinberg and Sandy LeonVest challenge the dominant narrative by discussing the ways in which people can create a 21st century energy economy that puts the environment before corporate profits and “mirrors natures elegance,” while being resilient enough to reign in energy consumption — and consumption in general. <br />
They wrap up the hour talking about “energy democracy” — and the need for a radical new energy model that eschews corporate-owned power in favor of power owned by the people.
