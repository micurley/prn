title: Will The Real Evil-Doers Please Stand Up? The War On Terror
---
On this, the 11th anniversary of George W.
<!--more-->
Bush’s Axis of Evil speech, Sandy LeonVest talks to author and investigative journalist David Lindorff about the ominous and prophetic nature of that speech, delivered on January 29, 2002 by then-president George W. <br />
Bush. <br />
They  discuss the endless nature of the war on terror, and the ways in which it has been ratcheted up and become “even more evil” under the Obama administration.
<br />
Eleven years ago to the day, when Bush delivered what was his second State of the Union address, it signaled the beginning of a relentless crusade by the US government against so-called “Islamic terrorists,” known as the “war on terror.<br />
” That crusade was destined to change the world – at least as most Americans understood it – fundamentally and irrevocably.
<br />
David Lindorff is the author of many books, including The Case for Impeachment, in which he lays out a legal case for why the Bush/Cheney administration should have been impeached. <br />
His work can be found at www.thiscantbehappening.net, as well as at http://www.eurasiareview.<br />
com/author/dave-lindorff/.
<br />
Today, Dave is working on another book — which might reasonably be titled, “The Case for Impeachment II — How Obama Managed to Out-Evil George W. <br />
Bush.”
