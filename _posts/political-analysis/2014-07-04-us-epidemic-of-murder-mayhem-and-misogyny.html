title: US EPIDEMIC OF MURDER, MAYHEM AND MISOGYNY
---
Tonight on Political Analysis, DeSmog Blog’s Steve Horn makes his debut as Sandy’s co-host.
<!--more-->
 

Sandy and Steve kick off the hour with Truthout.<br />
org’s Candice Bernd. <br />
They discuss a disturbing upsurge in cases involving women being brutalized, sexually assaulted and/or murdered — often by the same people charged with protecting them. <br />
Candice wrote the piece published at Truthout.org, headlined, “Police Departments Ignore Rampant Sexual Assault by Officers.<br />
” She talks about the epidemic of misogyny and police sexual abuse cases, as well as the bizarre murders that took place recently in Kenosha Wisconsin. <br />
 

KEY ENVIRONMENTAL RULING COULD BE A GAME-CHANGER 

At the bottom of the hour, Sandy and Steve are joined by Nathaniel Shoaff, staff attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program (based in San Francisco). <br />
Nathaniel discusses the lawsuit he won this week in the US District Court for the District of  Colorado. <br />
  The case, titled, Sierra Club Et Al v. <br />
US Forest Service Et Al, was handed down by (federal court) Judge R. <br />
Jackson, on June 27, who blocked a coal mining project in Colorado because, he said, federal agencies “failed to consider the future global-warming damages from burning fossil fuels.<br />
”  

*Political Analysis’ new co-host Steve Horn brings to the show his keen intelligence, an astute grasp of the issues and a youthful exuberance that is sure to light up the control room. <br />
His refreshingly radical perspective is both balanced and supported by his intrepid investigative reporting, his research work with DeSmog Blog and, before that, his research and reporting at the Center for Media and Democracy. <br />
 Steve’s creative, no-holds-barred approach to journalism is fueled by a passion rarely seen in today’s “play-it-safe” political environment. <br />
He is a fiercely independent thinker, which deems it appropriately fortuitous that he arrives on the scene just one day before Independence Day. <br />
  Look for lots of fireworks in the weeks to come! <br />
