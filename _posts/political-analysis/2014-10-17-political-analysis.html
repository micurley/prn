First Segment:
RACISM AND THE MILITARIZATION OF EBOLA: 
Medical Apartheid, “Bioeconomic Warfare” and<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Neoliberalism

 Sandy is joined for the first half-hour by author, activist and scholar Dr Horace G. <br />
Campbell, Professor of African American Studies and Political Science at Syracuse University in New York. 
Dr Horace Campbell is the author of numerous books, his most recent, Global NATO and the Catastrophic Failure in Libya (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583674128/counterpunchmaga), published in 2013, has been met with wide acclaim from the academic press and progressives alike.<br />
 
Among other issues, Dr Campbell talks about how the “progressive left” is failing to connect the dots with respect to racism and the militarized response to Ebola (and everything else) in West Africa — and the continent at large. <br />
He makes an impassioned plea for progressives to take on the issue of systemic, globalized racism and the “debasing” of black Africans, whom, to this day, suffer profoundly from ongoing colonialism and neoliberal policies, as illustrated by West Africa’s devastated healthcare infrastructure.
<br />
He talks about bio-economic warfare, medical apartheid and his recent piece published last week at Counterpunch (http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/10/10/ebola-the-african-union-and-bioeconomic-warfare/)  
From his early years in Jamaica, Dr Campbell has been involved in the Black Liberation Struggle and in the struggle for peace and justice, and he’s been an influential force all over the world, lecturing and offering alternatives to the hegemonic ideas of capitalism.<br />
 
While at the University of Dar es Salaam, he was the Secretary of the Liberation Support Committee. <br />
As a member of the Dar Es Salaam school he was active in debates on the transition beyond colonialism. <br />
At Syracuse University, he is the Director of the Africa Initiatives and  works in the wider Syracuse Community as a peace activist. <br />
He is a board member of the Syracuse Peace Council.
<br />
Second Segment:
FIGHT AGAINST KILLER COAL FAR FROM OVER: 
Big Coal’s Last, Gigantic, Mountain-Swallowing Last Gasp

During the second half of the show, Sandy is joined by Head-On Radio’s Bob Kincaid and activist Bo Webb. <br />
They discuss Big Coal and the ongoing practice of “mountaintop removal,” which continues to devastate communities in and around the Appalachian Mountains. <br />
They also talk about the ACHE Act, which Bo Webb describes as “elegant,” in that it demands that the health and welfare of communities be absolutely assured before any other mountaintop removal projects go forward.<br />
 
The ACHE Act (HR 526) establishes a moratorium on new mountaintop removal mining permits while the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences initiates comprehensive studies into the health effects of the mining on people in surrounding communities. <br />
It would halt new or enlarged mountaintop removal permits unless and until the federal government completes a definitive health study determining that the process does not harm residents’ health.
<br />

The two activists explain why the ACHE Act is so important, and why the battle against Big Coal isn’t over yet.
