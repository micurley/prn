sight, triple-digit heat continues to cook the planet, droughts intensify in the Midwestern region of the US, and heavily forested areas in Colorado, Utah and other parts of the planet go up in flames. <br />
Tonight on Political Analysis, host Sandy LeonVest opens the show with audio excerpts from Friends of the Earth Nigeria’s Nnimmo Bassey and renowned author/scientist David Suzuki, speaking with Amy Goodman about the utter failure of the corporate-dominated Rio+20 summit to make meaningful progress toward a sustainable future.
<br />

Later in the show, acclaimed “climate-denier debunker” Peter Sinclair joins SLV to talk about the most recent USGS report, which found record rising sea levels on the US East coast and other “hot spots.<br />
” They discuss ongoing climate-denial, even in the face of record high temperatures and extreme weather events (including droughts and floods). <br />
They manage to wrap up the hour on a positive note, talking about the myriad of available solutions — and the ways in which communities are “doing it for themselves,” even as the climate crisis escalates and continues to be ignored by the corporate-owned media and our “representatives” in Washington.<br />
