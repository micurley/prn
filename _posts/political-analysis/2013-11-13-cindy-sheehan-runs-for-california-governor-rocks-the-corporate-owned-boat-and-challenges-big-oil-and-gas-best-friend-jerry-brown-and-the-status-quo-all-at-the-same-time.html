title: Cindy Sheehan Runs for California Governor, Rocks the Corporate- Owned Boat,
    and Challenges Big Oil and Gas’ Best Friend Jerry Brown (And the Status Quo) —
    All at the Same Time

Tonight on Political Analysis, Sandy LeonVest talks to activist, author and California gubernatorial candidate Cindy<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Sheehan, whose current run for governor, on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, threatens to seriously challenge status quo politics, business as usual, and the corporate-owned media who perpetrate the corporate-owned message.
<br />
They discuss Cindy’s run against then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2008, and her current run against California governor Jerry Brown in 2014.
<br />
Once considered to be an “environmentalist,” (remember “Governor Moonbeam?<br />
”) Jerry Brown has been transformed in recent years into what one reporter described as, “Big Oil’s Best Friend,” going so far as to sign an environmentally devastating bill, that will allow Big Oil and Gas companies, like Venoco, Occidental and Shell, to turn much what is left of the Central California coastline into a wasteland of hydrofracking.
<br />
They also discuss Cindy’s transformation from a liberal Democrat into a “radical” (in the literal sense of the word, which, in Latin means “root”), after her son Casey was killed in Iraq on April 4, 2004. <br />
Cindy talks about her passion for challenging “business as usual,” the corrupt two party system, and her plan to challenge the economic status quo, known as “corporate capitalism.”
