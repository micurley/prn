Guests: Journalist/Author Paul M. Barrett and Biologist/Activist/Author Dr.

Sandra Steingraber  
It’s a matter of public record that Chevron and other Big Oil companies are environmental criminals – no question about that. <br />
But, tonight’s guest on Political Analysis– journalist and author Paul M. <br />
Barrett - argues that the story behind Ecuador’s (now more than two-decades-old) lawsuit against Chevron is not quite as cut and dry as the progressive media would have us believe. <br />
PM Barrett has poured over court documents and countless other materials related to the Ecuador v Chevron case, all of which have lead him to conclude that the plaintiffs — including leading New York attorney Steven Donziger — may be exploiting the people of the Ecuadorian rainforests for their own reasons. <br />
On tonight’s Political Analysis, Paul M. <br />
Barrett joins Sandy LeonVest and Steve Horn for the first half hour, to discuss Chevron in Ecuador — and the tort suit filed more than two decades ago by attorney Steven Donziger. <br />
PM Barrett has a fiercely independent and unique point of view about Ecuador’s case against Chevron — one that, while not popular with progressives, is well-researched, scupulously documented — and has a ring of truth to it that should not be minimized or ignored. <br />
PM Barrett is author of the book “Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun,” as well as a soon-to-be-published book titled, “Law of the Jungle: The $19 Billion Legal Battle Over Oil in the Rain Forest and the Lawyer Who’d Stop at Nothing to Win.<br />
” He is assistant managing editor and senior writer at Bloomberg Businessweek and a former editor and legal affairs reporter for The Wall Street Journal. <br />
Later in the hour, Activist/Author Sandra Steingraber joins Steve and Sandy to discuss (among other things) LNG, fracked gas AND her July 25th speaking engagement in Berkeley, where she will address the damaging impact of fracking on human health.
