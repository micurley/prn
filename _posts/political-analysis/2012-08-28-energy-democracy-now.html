TAKING BACK THE POWER in the 21st CENTURY
Forget Corporate Control and the Centralized Grid – Community-Owned Power Is<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Tonight, as Hurricane Isaac moves headlong toward the US Gulf Coast’s “refinery row” and firefighters in Venezuela extinguish the last remnants of a deadly oil refinery fire there that killed 48 people over the weekend, Political Analysis host Sandy LeonVest reports on how the “double whammy impact” of the hurricane combined with Venezuela’s refinery fire could impact US consumers.
<br />


To punctuate the point, Sandy is joined by Justin Guay of the Sierra Club’s International Climate Program. <br />
Justin recently wrote an article on India’s massive power outage — and how a deal between India’s OMC Power and Bharti Infratel (India’s largest mobile phone provider) illustrates that community power really is the way of the future. <br />
They
talk about what’s coming to be known as “energy democracy” — the imperative of abandoning dirty, highly centralized fossil fuel sources for decentralized renewable power generation — owned by the PEOPLE.
