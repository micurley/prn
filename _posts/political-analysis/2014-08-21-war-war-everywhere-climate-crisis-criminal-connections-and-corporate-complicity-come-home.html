Corporate Complicity. <br />
 From the occupied territories of Palestine to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, the outrage over what can best be described as a systemic, institutionalized form of oppression — or Apartheid — is becoming palpable across the globe. <br />
  As an increasingly dark picture emerges of what some still call the “New World Order,” the connections between war, energy, the economy, accererating climate change and the increasingly draconian militarization of policing — once considered the purview of “radical journalists” or even “conspiracy theorists” — now scream at us to take notice. <br />
 This Thursday, August 21, Steve and Sandy talk about those connections — and much, much more.
