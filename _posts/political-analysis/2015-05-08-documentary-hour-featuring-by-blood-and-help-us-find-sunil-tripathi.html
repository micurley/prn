The May 7, 2015 edition of “Political Analysis” on The Progressive Radio Network featured the work and voices of two<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
documentarians: Marcos Barbery and Neal Broffman. 

1.<br />
) Marcos Barbery, Director and Producer of the newly-released documentary film “By Blood,” which is a contemporary and historical account of the African-American Freedmen of Cherokee descent, who were enslaved by the Cherokee Tribe and have still yet to achieve the rights and benefits they argue are owed to them by the Tribe. <br />
The movie raises fascinating questions about race, identity and history and is timely given what’s going on as of late in Baltimore, Ferguson and other US cities.
<br />
Barbery is a filmmaker and journalist and founder of THREAD Productions.<br />
The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute has supported Barbery’s reporting. <br />
Barbery’s writing has been featured by Long Reads, and appeared in Salon, The Huffington Post, and This Land Press. 

2.<br />
) Neal Broffman, Director and Producer of the new documentary film “Help Us Find Sunil Tripathi“ about Sunil Tripathi, who was initially misidentified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev during the initial manhunt for Dzhokhar and his now-dead brother Tamerlan (then known as “Suspect One” and “Suspect Two”). <br />
Sunil was eventually found dead (having committed suicide) in a river near Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, but not before the damage was done and his name forever tied to the April 2013 bombing. <br />
The movie’s recent release coincides with the ongoing death penalty phase of USA v. <br />
Tsarnaev case occurring in a US District Court in Boston.
<br />

Sunil’s mom Judy or his sister Ravi will also be on the show, joining Neal Broffman.
<br />
Help Us Find Sunil Tripathi had its world premiere in March, 2015 at the Atlanta Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Feature Film. <br />
The international premiere was in April-May of 2015 at the renowned Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, where it was also included in Docs For School.
