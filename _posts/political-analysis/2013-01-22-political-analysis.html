The only climate change legislation to ever pass the US House was called cap and trade. <br />
The legislation did not pass the US Senate.<br />
  At this time of major drought across the US and superstorms like Sandy, we still do not have one of the essential keys to slowing climate change:  Federal legislation. <br />
 We’ll talk today with 2 esteemed guests about the failure to pass federal climate legislation.  Who’s at fault?  DC Environmentalists?  President Obama?  The right-wing?  What it will take to pass such legislation?<br />
  Is a regulatory approach a better strategy?
<br />
