Three guests joined Sandy Leonvest and Steve Horn on the show for this week.

For the first third of the show, Sam<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

Daniel, a campaigner for Greenpeace Israel, came on to talk to Steve about the massive oil spill that recently took place in southern Israel, where clean up efforts have just begun. <br />
It was the biggest spill in the history of the country.
<br />

For the second third, “Newsvandal,” historian and investigative journalist JP Sottile joined Steve and Sandy to discuss plummeting global oil prices and ask the questions: who, what and why? <br />
They also discussed the central role of OPEC and the Saudi Arabian autocracy, as well as the key role of the dollar empire and “petrodollars.<br />
”
And for the last part of the show, Steve and Sandy chatted with Anne Petermann, executive director of the Global Ecology Justice Project, about the failed (or a success, for corporate sponsors) of the Lima, Peru United Nations climate negotiations, as well as deforestation issues in Paraguay. <br />
They also discussed the “people’s climate summit,” a counter to the corporate-dominated event in Lima.<br />
