discuss the deplorable state of American politics today – and what we (still) can do to change it. <br />
The two journalists talk about the nation’s critical need for progressive leadership, transformation and inspiration, along with Lisa Jackson’s resignation last week as EPA head (saying she didn’t want to reside over the agency when — not if — Obama approved the Keystone XL pipeline).
<br />
Also discussed, the Obama administration’s nomination today of John Brenner (one of the “fathers” of drone warfare) to head the CIA, Obama’s signing of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the utter failure of mainstream corporate Democrats to challenge the administration’s inhumane policies overseas — including “extraordinary rendition” and torture and his pandering to the most reactionary elements of the Republican party — all in the interest of “compromise.<br />
” Norman Solomon’s brilliant, insightful and compassionate perspective offers a refreshing and inspiring alternative for those who need reminding that we actually do have a critical role to play in the shaping of politics — and our children’s futures.
