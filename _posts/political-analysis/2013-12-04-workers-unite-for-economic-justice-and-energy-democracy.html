WORKERS UNITE FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND ENERGY DEMOCRACY
On tonight’s Political Analysis, Sandy Leon Vest is joined by<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
Dr Sean Sweeney of the Global Labor Institute to discuss the push for Energy Democracy, the Energy Democracy Initiative and the burgeoning global movement for the democratization of vital resources, including food, water and energy.
<br />
Dr Sweeney talks about what his organization and others — trade unionists, academics and climate justice activists — are doing to build international alliances between workers, activists and movement leaders of all stripes in order to make a successful — and economically just — transition to a 21st century economy.
<br />
They also discuss the Trade Unions for Energy Democracy initiative, launched last October (2012) in New York City at the Energy Emergency, Energy Transition roundtable. <br />
The purpose of the roundtable was to articulate trade union responses to the unimpeded rise in the use of fossil fuels, which is leading to ‘carbon lock in’ and out-of-control greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. <br />
Other items included the growing political influence of oil, coal and gas companies, as well as formulating alternatives to the current market-based approaches to energy transition. <br />
They also discuss hyper-consumption on a planet of finite resources — and the “C”-word (capitalism).
