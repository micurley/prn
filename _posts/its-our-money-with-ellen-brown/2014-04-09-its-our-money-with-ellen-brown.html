A sure sign that our monetary system is in deep distress is the
proliferation of public movements trying to deal with<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
the outfall of failing
economies and struggling households. <br />
On this edition of “It’s Our Money with
Ellen Brown”, Ellen speaks with two leading protagonists helping individual
citizens take matters into their own hands by adopting new economic models
and alternatives; attorney Kevin Zeese and Dr Margaret Flowers discuss
current public initiatives, the TPP, Obamacare and a foundational philosophy
that asserts that individual citizens are the core of new civic leadership.
<br />
On this week’s Public Banking Report, co-host Walt McRee speaks with the
leader of one of those new alternative movements, Marc Armstrong, who is
launching BankACT.org, a lobbying campaign to help re-establish banking
services at America’s post offices.<br />
