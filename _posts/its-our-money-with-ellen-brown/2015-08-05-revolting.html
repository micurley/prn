title: Revolting

Is the financial deprivation of entire nations engendering a new level of frustration and political unrest?
<!--more-->
Are the unlikely top-ranked US presidential candidates a sign that the Europeans aren’t the only ones who want to “throw the bums out?<br />
”  Ellen engages these emerging political themes in her conversation with renown author, advisor and Economics professor Michael Hudson, just back from his consultations with Greece’s Syriza party. <br />
But also revolting is the blatant theft of national assets and impoverishment of the citizens of nations whose governments got caught up in the shady dealings of global bankers and their political cronies. <br />
To relieve the pressure, Swami Beyondananda offers a simple soliloquy on the money world and we borrow a bit of consumer financial planning advice from author Nomi Prins.
