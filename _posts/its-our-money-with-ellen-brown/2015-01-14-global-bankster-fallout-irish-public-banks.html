title: Global Bankster Fallout & Irish Public Banks
---
When economic towers collapse, effects are felt.
<!--more-->
In the case of the recent, sudden and significant drop in oil prices, pain may reverberate around the world as major financial institutions are put at significant risk of failure. <br />
And then there is the fallout from bank failures that become stratagems for global bankers to take new control of countries. <br />
Ellen examines these important developments and talks with Irish political leader Mark Dearey who is actively supporting creation of public banks to help recover from virtual extortion by global bankers. <br />
And co-host Walt McRee talks with economy-reformer Marc Armstrong about his new “Commonomics” initiative that aims to unify citizen activism to protect and support public assets.
