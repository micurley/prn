the limitations of its debt-based
control. <br />
This week, Ellen speaks with Mark Pash of the Center for
Progressive Economics, who believes that issuance of currency as debt has
outlived its usefulness and should be replaced with a credit-based model
that covers basic human needs prior to personal accumulation of additional
affluence. <br />
 Ellen also speaks with Mike Krauss on petro-dollar politics

On the
Public Banking Report, co-host Walt McRee talks with John Leonard of the PA

industrial centers, western PA, and the promise that public banking agencies
may offer to reviving the economy that region.
