title: The Legality of Using Eminent Domain to Stem Foreclosures
---
Cities around the country have been ravaged by significant numbers of community foreclosures following the mortgage<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
loan scandals of recent years. <br />
Big banks have been wheeling and dealing these finance contracts, often illegally, to execute fraudulent takings of property or profiteering from servicing fees. <br />
But they may now be facing their Achilles Heel with challenges to their ownership by bold government leaders who want to stanch the bleeding of community economic health.<br />
  Ellen talks with the pioneer of this eminent domain legal stratagem, Prof. <br />
Robert Hockett of Cornell University, about the legal rationale and the probability of its success in Richmond, CA and elsewhere. <br />
Ellen also reviews notable recent monetary news items and co-host Walt McRee provides an update on news from the world of the public banking movement. <br />
