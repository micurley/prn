It isn’t just the Greeks, or the Cypriots, or the Irish, or the Icelanders suffering the price of financial terrorism –<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
the extractive demands of global central banks on display in Greece are actively draining the marrow of impoverished communities the world over. <br />
Ellen speaks with author and expert Stephen Lendman about the financial powers forcibly overruling Greek democracy, and their intentions to do so everywhere.  Co-host Walt McRee speaks with an official of one California county government pushing back against convicted bank felons, and later discusses new human evolutionary awareness about our relationship with money with philosopher Robert Bows.<br />
  And Matt Stannard discusses our myths about “the Great American Entrepreneur” on the Public Banking Report.
