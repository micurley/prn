of geographic boundaries and economic responsibility would greatly improve the US and states like California.

Starobin suggests that America’s broke, ill-governed and way-too-big nationlike state, California, might be saved, truly saved, not by an emergency federal bailout, but by a merciful carve-up into three republics that would rely on their own ingenuity in making their connections to the wider world.
