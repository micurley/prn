What Would Dr. King Do?
Were he alive today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
<!--more-->
would “highlight Wall Street criminality,” “war crimes coming out of the White House, the Pentagon, and the State Department” and “the social crimes of the New Jim Crow, the criminal justice system, which is itself criminal,” said Dr Cornel West, of the Union Theological Seminary, in New York. <br />
“Martin would be very, very sad when he looked at the fraudulent character of Black leadership, the massive capitulation to the White House.<br />
”
The slain civil rights leader “would be in righteous opposition to the American regime of austerity and war, and to a president and his administration that is in the vanguard of it,” according to Dr Anthony Monteiro, professor of African American Studies at Temple University, in Philadelphia. <br />
“King was, at the end of the day, a democratic revolutionary. <br />
He was calling for an uprising to the forces of injustice and war,” said Monteiro. <br />
In contrast, today’s “Black petit bourgeoisie are more interested in their own comfort than they are in social justice.<br />
”
Black Women’s Wage Gap
The wage gap between men and African American women is 70 cents on the dollar, according to a study of US Census Bureau data by the National Partnership for Women and Families. <br />
Sarah Crawford, the group’s director of workplace fairness, said “nearly 40 percent of households headed by African American women are living in poverty, so this lost pay in particularly critical for those families. <br />
The difference in earnings amounts to more than $14,000 each year.<br />
”
Fictional Fiscal Crisis
“The conservatives, the Republicans, the business lobby, have been allowed to control the debate” over fiscal policy “because they’ve created the idea that we have this big deficit crisis,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. <br />
“And it really is a fiction.” Such false assumptions are why “programs like Medicare and Social Security are on the chopping block.”
Pace of Police Killings of Blacks Increases
Kali Akuno, one of the authors of last year’s Malcolm X Grassroots Movement report on extrajudicial killings of Blacks, said “we are already noticing that, by our count, there’s been ten Black men who’ve been killed by police in 2013, and that’s faster than the pace of 2012.<br />
” Akuno spoke earlier this month on a National Forum on Police Brutality and Institutional Racism, on Your World News, hosted by Solomon Comissiong and Peter Fowler.
<br />
Obama’s War Mongers
“Virtually everybody on the top echelon of the Obama foreign policy team, they all backed the Iraq War,” points out Sam Husseini, communications director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. <br />
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, tapped for Secretary of Defense, fits the bill. <br />
John Brennan, the White House intelligence advisor who got the president’s nod to head the CIA, meets every week with Obama “to decide who they are going to kill,” said Husseini. <br />
“He at one point claimed that there were no civilian deaths from the drone program, though we know there are civilian deaths.”
