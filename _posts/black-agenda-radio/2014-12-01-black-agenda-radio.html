Ferguson Creates Crisis for U.S.

Rulers
“This government is on edge,” said Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations. <br />
“This government has an incredible quandary in dealing with the re-emergence of Black people in this ‘post-racial’ situation that’s supposed to be defined by the presidency of Barack Obama.<br />
” White people are on edge, too. <br />
“There’s no editorials being written about the fact that white people are arming themselves to the teeth in the whole Missouri area,” said Yeshitela. <br />
“It’s a crisis of great magnitude and they have no idea how to deal with it.<br />
”
Black America Must Appeal to International Allies
“At the end of the day, if this epidemic of police killings is” to be halted, “we are going to have to appeal to the international community,” as did Blacks of past generations, said Dr Gerald Horne, historian and professor of African American Studies at the University of Houston. <br />
“It’s no accident that RT in Moscow, CCTV in China, Telesur in Venezuela, Prensa Latina of Cuba, and Press TV of Iran have been much more incisive” on Ferguson “than many of our local and domestic outlets.<br />
” Horne was interviewed on the Real News Network, as was Kevin Alexander Gray, the Columbia, South Carolina activist and author. <br />
“What needs to change is the ability of police on the street to invoke the death penalty without due process,” said Gray. <br />
Ferguson cop Darren Wilson “got a lot of due process; Michael Brown got none. <br />
What’s gonna happen is, people are going to have to rethink what self-defense means in this country, in light of giving the police such unfettered power.<br />

Mumia: Ferguson Enters Pantheon of Black Pain
“The name Ferguson joins an ancient line of place names of pain, loss and Black death – places like Birmingham, Philadelphia and, now, Ferguson,” said Mumia Abu Jamal, the nation’s best known political prisoner. <br />
In a report for Prison Radio, Abu Jamal said that some Blacks will seal away the memory of Ferguson, while “others will grow in radicalism, convinced that this case is the very epitome of racist injustice.<br />

Pinkney Promises “Breaking News” Before His Sentencing
Facing 25 years in prison following his conviction on charges of tampering with an election recall petition, Rev. <br />
Edward Pinkney “promises” to have “breaking news” before he is sentenced on December 15. <br />
The Benton Harbor, Michigan, community leader said he was “shocked” that he could be found guilty by an all-white jury “with absolutely no witnesses.<br />
” Police officer Darren Wilson, in Ferguson, Missouri, “murdered a boy with witnesses. <br />
Here, they’re about to send me to jail for the rest of my life with no witnesses, with no evidence at all,” said Pinkney, age 65. <br />
He promised revelations that will blow the case out of the water.

Obama’s Secret Afghan War Extension
Weeks before the November elections, President Obama secretly extended the US combat role in Afghanistan through the end of 2015. <br />
The president’s conduct holds no surprises for author and anti-war activist David Swanson, publisher of the influential web site WarIsACrime.<br />
Org. <br />
“Obama has been given credit for six years for ending a war that he tripled in size,” said Swanson. <br />
“This is his war, far more than George W. <br />
Bush’s, in terms of death, destruction, injuries, refugees, money spent, time spent – and he’s gonna keep it going.”<br />
