“Broad Social Movement” Confronts Philadelphia’s Temple University
 



Protests against the firing of Temple<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
University African American Studies professor Anthony Monteiro have evolved into a “broad united front” of students, grassroots community forces, organized labor and elected officials. <br />
“Black Philadelphia, in particular, understands that Temple University is not only gentrifying the community, but is hyper-policing the community,” creating “an island of privilege in a city of poverty,” said Dr Monteiro. <br />
“All that was necessary was for someone to stand up and say that this powerful institution must be made answerable to the community.<br />
”



CIA Plays Both Sides in Iraq
 



“The CIA has a long history of being on both sides of conflicts that we later sacrifice a great deal to address,” said Shahid Buttar, executive director of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee. <br />
The jihadist fighters of ISIS, currently on the offensive in Iraq, have benefited from US and allied support for regime change in Syria. <br />
In the past, the CIA “trained the precursor of al Qaida in Afghanistan” and supported Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq. <br />
Buttar, a constitutional lawyer, has produced a video titled “NSA vs USA,” a “hip hop history lesson set to music.<br />
”



Massachusetts to Have Highest State Minimum Wage
 



The Massachusetts state legislature has passed, and the governor is certain to sign, a bill to raise the minimum wage from $8 to $11 over three years – the highest state minimum in the country. <br />
Lew Finfer, director of the Massachusetts Community Action Network, credits the victory to a “broad coalition” of faith-based, community and labor organizations that collected over 200,000 signatures to put the wage hike on the ballot, this fall. <br />
The threat of a referendum worked. <br />
“Had we not gotten the signatures,” the legislature “would not have passed a bill or would have passed much less of a wage increase,” said Finfer.

Petition to Block Ugandan from UN Post
 



Sam Kutesa, Uganda’s Foreign Minister, is unfit to assume the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly, according to a petition circulating on Change.<br />
org. <br />
Kutesa is engaged in massive corruption and theft of public funds, war-profiteering in South Sudan, and is complicit in Uganda’s genocidal crimes against the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Milton Allimadi, publisher of the New York-based Black Star News. <br />
“He diminishes the legacy and the name of other Africans who have served as president of the UN General Assembly, and should resign.<br />
” Kutesa was elected to the UN post without opposition.

Syrian Election Shows People’s Determination
 



The recent elections in war-torn Syria, which President Bashar al-Assad won handily, were a demonstration of the Syrian people’s determination to prevail against western and jihadist “terror,” said Paul Larudee, part of an international team of election observers. <br />
The US and Israel are intent on sowing “eternal conflict and death and destruction” in the region. <br />
However, “I don’t think [the Syrians] are going to lose this war,” said Larudee, a member of the International Palestine Solidarity Network. <br />
“They’re absolutely determined.”
