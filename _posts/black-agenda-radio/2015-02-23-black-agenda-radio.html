The movie portrayed Kagame’s forces as the good guys, but Rusesabagina, now in exile, tells a different story. <br />

The Worst “Crap Hole” Among Pennsylvania’s Prisons
Prisoners rate Frackville State Prison as “a crap hole” and “perhaps the worst” facility in the state’s prison system, said inmate Bryant Arroyo, in a report to Prison Radio. <br />
Arroyo calls Frackville an “anonymous fiefdom” where “the guards seem to find great pride, even honor, in perpetrating their anti-prisoner culture” of “unrestrained authority, separate from the state correctional system.” Frackville is also home to Mumia Abu Jamal, the nation’s best known political prisoner.<br />
