Mumia Abu Jamal, the nation’s best known political prisoner, has been confirmed to be suffering from hepatitis C, a<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
serious liver disease that doctors believe played a part in his near-death, earlier this year, from diabetic shock. <br />
But, the State of Pennsylvania doesn’t provide adequate treatment for prison inmates with Hepatitus C. <br />
Attorney Brete Grote says the state’s inaction has caused Abu Jamal’s legal team to file papers in court.
<br />
Despite his medical problems, Mumia continues to write regular essays for Prison Radio. <br />
Here’s his latest, entitled, “Donald Trump and the Politics of Resentment.<br />
” 
Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan is gearing up for the 20th anniversary of the historic Million Man March, October 10th, in Washington, DC. <br />
The event will be held under the slogan, “justice or else.<br />
” Speaking at the Mount Zion Baptist Church, in Miami, Florida, Farrakhan said Black folks should seek vengeance against their oppressors.
<br />
We recently spoke with one of the nation’s most respected human rights movement couples: former political prisoner and people’s lawyer Lynne Stewart, and veteran Black activist Ralph Poynter. <br />
Poynter is part of the Black Is Back Coalition, which holds its national conference in Philadelphia August 22nd and 23rd. <br />
The Black Is Back Coalition is pushing for Black Community Control of Police.
<br />
Efia Nwangaza, director of the Malcolm X Center for Self-Determination, in Greenville, South Carolina, and its community radio station, WMXC, is also a longtime people’s lawyer. <br />
Wangaza has taken a leading role in persuading the United Nations to denounce how the US treats prison inmates, especially its massive use of solitary confinement. <br />
Last month, to great fanfare, President Obama promised to commission a study on reducing solitary confinement. <br />
We asked Efia Nwangaza if she is impressed.
<br />
Lastly, Sara Flounders, talks about President Obama uphill battle to prevent Congress from scuttling his deal to cancel massive sanctions against Iran. <br />
US sanctions and western war threats against Iran are based on the charge that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. <br />
However, in 2007 and again in 2011, all 16 US intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that Iran had no military nuclear program. <br />
So, the question is, how do you deal with a US policy on Iran based on lies that even US intelligence agencies don’t believe?<br />
