Both Parties Sabotaging Entitlement Programs
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid “have been set up to take the fall<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
for the nation’s deficit,” said Dr Maya Rockeymoore, president of Washington-based Global Policy Solutions. <br />
President Obama “views it as his legacy to rein in entitlement programs while creating this grand bargain” with the Republicans. <br />
Those who expected a more progressive Obama in his second term are mistaken. <br />
“I think that the president did not make a Freudian slip in his first debate when he said that he and Mitt Romney actually agree on Social Security.<br />
”
EPA Chief Used Alias
Lisa Jackson was forced to resign as chief of the Environmental Protection Agency because she conducted some of her public duties under an alias, said famed whistleblower Dr Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, of the NO FEAR Coalition. <br />
Jackson was “extremely upset” with the Occupy Movement, which staged demonstrations against “her cowardly behavior” as guardian of the environment. <br />
Dr Coleman-Adebayo believes Jackson used her alias to cloak her role in government spying on movement activists.

End Stop-and-Frisk
“We feel that 2013 has to be a year of rising resistance to stop-and-frisk in the streets and in the courtrooms,” said Carl Dix, a founder of Stop Mass Incarceration Network. <br />
“We’re not talking about mending an injustice; we’re talking about ending it.<br />
” The capitalist system is incapable of providing a “future for millions and millions of young people growing up in the urban areas of the country,” said Dix. <br />
“You can put Black faces in high places, but if it’s the same system that has oppressed and exploited you, it’s not going to change. <br />
Revolution is the solution.<br />
”
Big Brother Obama Hears All
President Obama has shown himself to be a more aggressive foe of civil liberties than George Bush. <br />
“Absolutely, we’ve seen this to be true from the FISA authorization, to the use of drones, and with the NDAA” preventive detention bill, said Samantha Peetros, spokesperson for the Bill of Rights Defense Committee. <br />
Just before New Years, Obama signed a five-year extension of legislation allowing warrantless phone and email surveillance.

Charters Crowding Out Public Schools in Philly
“I think that there is a growing movement among decision makers to shut the door on public education,” said W. <br />
Curtis Thomas, a Black state lawmaker from Philadelphia. <br />
The city has targeted 60 public schools for closing, while expanding charter schools by 5,000 seats. <br />
“The decision to move kids towards these charter schools is really an effort to resegregate a system that was never totally integrated, anyway,” said Rep. <br />
Thomas.
