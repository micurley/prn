Wal-Mart-Free Newark
As “the leader in the retail industry in paying its workers the lowest wages,” Wal-Mart should be<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

barred from doing business in Newark, New Jersey, said Larry Hamm, chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress. <br />
“We need living wage jobs,” said Hamm. <br />
“The minimum wage is a slave wage.<br />
”
Wal-Mart Exploits Obamacare
President Obama’s health care legislation has been a special boon to Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest corporation. <br />
“What changes with Obamacare is that anybody making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level now qualifies for Medicaid,” said journalist Mary Wheeler. <br />
In recent months, Wal-Mart has cut the hours of large numbers of workers. <br />
“There’s a big incentive for Wal-Mart to make sure that as many of their employees are below the federal poverty level” as possible, said Wheeler.

Multinationals Super-Exploit Third World Workers
Labor unions, elected officials and grassroots activists in New York demanded that multinational corporations be made accountable for working conditions at factories in the developing world. <br />
“We must push them to sign the international Fire Safety Act and follow international labor laws,” said Fazi Foezia, a member of DRUM – Desis Rising Up and Moving – and a Bengladesh national. <br />
“They exploit our workers and don’t pay taxes to our governments.<br />
” Garment factory fires in Bengladesh and Pakistan have killed hundreds in recent months.

Raising Retail Wages Would Boost Economy
A study by Demos finds that “raising wages in the retails sector at the largest employers to a threshold of $25,000 a year for full-time, year-round workers would bring a million and a half people out of poverty, generate between $11 and $15 billion in GDP, and create between 100,000 and 132,000 new jobs.<br />
” Corporations would benefit, too, from a more loyal work force and greater consumer spending power.

Disaster Officials Offer Loans, Not Aid
Federal officials are more concerned with generating loans to fatten the $1 billion a year disaster loan service industry, than in providing direct aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy, according to a study by Strike Debt, an offshoot of the Occupy Movement. <br />
Credit-worthiness, rather than need, becomes the watchword, said Strike Debt spokesperson Pamela Brown. <br />
“By using the lens of debt, they are exacerbating any kinds of inequalities that are already existing” in disaster-struck areas, “putting renters and minority communities” in additional jeopardy.
<br />
No Charge, No Trial, No Justice
Civil and human rights activists gathered at Central Connecticut State University, at New Britain, for a conference on preventive detention, last weekend. <br />
President Obama’s preventive detention law, part of the National Defense Authorization Act, was designed to target “those who are engage in dissent,” said conference organizer Daniel Adams.<br />
  Activists should also oppose more recent legislation that might exempt US citizens from detention without charge or trial. <br />
“It’s got to be all of us or none of us,” said Adams.
