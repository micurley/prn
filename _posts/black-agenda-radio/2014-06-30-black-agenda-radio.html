Detroit Financial Dictator Uses Water as Weapon
 



The water cut-offs that could soon affect 30,000 Detroit<span class="ellipsis">...</span>
<!--more-->
households are “an effort on the part of the Emergency Financial Manager to intimidate people, to drive even more people out of the city – but, moreover, it is aimed at privatizing and breaking up the Detroit Water and Sewage Department,” said Abayomi Azikiwe, an organizer for the Moratorium Now Coalition and editor of the Pan African News Wire. <br />
A United Nations panel of experts called the shut-offs “an affront to human rights.<br />
”



Empower the Urban Renting Majority  
 



A new report on housing calls for a change in government policies that favor homeowners over renters. <br />
Titled “Renter Nation: Solutions to the Housing Affordability Crisis,” the report outlines “models of cooperative housing that allow for people to build wealth and also maintain an investment in the community they live in, and to maintain the housing that they live in as affordable for the people who come after them,” said Rachel LeForest, executive director of the Right to the City Alliance.

Socialist Takes on Washington State Speaker of House
 



“What’s lacking in state houses across the country are unambiguous fighters for working people and others who are disenfranchised,” said Jess Spear, the Socialist Alternative candidate for Washington House Speaker Frank Chopp’s seat. <br />
In 2012, Chopp won 70 percent of the vote against Socialist Alternative’s Kshama Sawant, who went on to win a seat on the Seattle City Council and passage of a $15 an hour municipal minimum wage. <br />
Spear said Chopp has failed to move a $12 an hour state minimum wage out of committee. <br />
“It really exposes him and the rest of the Democratic Party as just grandstanding and paying lip service to what working people need and    deserve,” she said.

Mass Conspiracy Charges in Harlem
 



Residents of two Harlem housing projects remain outraged over a 400-officer police raid that resulted in attempted murder, weapons and conspiracy charges against more than 100 young people. <br />
“They’re charging everybody with the crimes of a couple of people. <br />
It’s like you’re guilty by association,” said Angela Dunmore, at a press conference called by the Stop Mass Incarceration Network. <br />
New York City authorities “feel threatened by two or more Black men together – and that is not fair.<br />
”



H. <br />
Rap Brown/Jamil al-Amin Seriously Ill in Super-Max
 



The former chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Minister of Justice of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense, and revolutionary icon formerly known as H. <br />
Rap Brown, is seriously ill with a gum infection that has spread through his body. <br />
Jamil al-Amin’s “outspoken defense of self-defense earned him the eternal enmity of the government,” said political prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal, in a report for Prison Radio. <br />
Al-Amin is serving a life sentence at the federal super-max prison in Florence, Colorado, in the shooting of two Atlanta policemen.

Why “Freedom Summer” Activists Chose Voter Registration over Direct Action
 



Fifty years ago, organizers with SNCC and other civil rights organizations brought 1,000 mostly white students to Mississippi to assist in registering Black voters. <br />
On The Real News Network, former SNCC field director Bob Moses told host Paul Jay that activists considered mounting a direct action civil disobedience campaign instead of voter registration. <br />
“They were faced with whether they wanted to do the Nelson Mandela,” said Moses. <br />
“If they were going to do direct action, then they’ve got to stay in jail for a long time.”
