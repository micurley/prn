themselves as the victims” in the conflict with occupied Palestinians, said veteran human rights activist and BAR columnist Ajamu Baraka. <br />
However, “it now appears that Black leadership has lost its moral compass and are standing shoulder to shoulder with something as brutal and backward as the assault on Palestine,” said Baraka. <br />
Every member of the Congressional Black Caucus this month joined in a unanimous House resolution siding with Israel.

US Academics Largely Silent on Israeli Crimes
 



American academics are largely mum on Israeli brutality in Gaza, said Dr Johnny Williams, professor of sociology at Trinity College, in Hartford, Connecticut. <br />

“Back then, we said that his history and his policies were the exact opposite of reform,” said Trujillo. <br />
“I think now people are starting to have the conversation, after the death of Eric Garner, about what’s going on with Bratton’s ‘Broken Windows’ policing.<br />

Back in 2008, Rev. <br />
Kenneth Glascow won a lawsuit affirming the right of many incarcerated people to vote, in Alabama. <br />
Glascow and his Ordinary People Society have been making the rounds of county jails, to determine if they are in compliance with the law. <br />
