Michael Brown’s Killer Indicted by Black People’s Grand Jury
After two days of investigation and deliberations, a Black<span class="ellipsis">...</span>

People’s Grand Jury handed down a first degree murder indictment against former Ferguson, Missouri, policeman Darren Wilson in the death of teenager Michael Brown. <br />
Four Black prosecutors presented evidence to the 12 St. <br />
Louis County residents, who also drew on the records of the mostly white official grand jury that failed to indict Wilson in November. <br />
“Darren Wilson is a killer, but he’s not out there by himself,” said lead people’s prosecutor Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the International People’s Democratic Uhuru Movement. <br />
“Somebody made the decision to leave the body there for 4 ½ hours” in the blazing August heat. <br />
Darren Wilson “has been rewarded with almost a million dollars by white people. <br />
The problem is institutional, and this grand jury is more capable of understanding that” than the one that was seated and manipulated by St. <br />
Louis prosecutor Bob McCulloch.

An Awakening People
Dr Anthony Monteiro, the lifelong activist and former professor of African American Studies at Temple University, said young Black people are “awakening. <br />
They’re getting a sense of their power and what they can do without any corporate-designated leaders. <br />
And, once they’ve seen that, they’re going to connect the killing of Black people by the police to the economic and social crisis that engulfs the country.<br />
” Dr Monteiro was fired from his post at Temple for his political activism.

Beyond Issues of Brutality: Social Transformation
“What we’re seeing is the radicalization of a new generation,” said Ajamu Baraka, an editor and columnist for Black Agenda Report and fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. <br />
Through struggle, Black youth will learn that “what is absolutely required is a fundamental transformation of social relationships, and of the entire structure of oppression in this country.<br />
” Baraka was a co-founder of the US Human Rights Network.

America’s “Unworthy Victims”
Activist scholar Paul Street, author of the recent article, “Worthy and Unworthy Victims: From Vietnam and Iraq to Ferguson and New York,” said the United States lauds its soldiers and cops as saints. <br />
The message is: “They’re policing the world and keeping chaos at bay; they’re nobly sacrificing themselves for the common good.” Meanwhile, “the folks on the other end of our guns” die in far greater numbers: millions killed in Vietnam and Iraq and untold numbers murdered under color of law in the “homeland.”<br />
