Charles P.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nGibbs, Executive Director of United Religions Initiative (uri.org) about URI’s planetary network of 560 locally initiated Cooperation Circles in 82 countries; each Cooperation Circle (consisting of at least 7 people from at least 3 faith traditions) decides on a local project that will further interfaith cooperation, help end religiously motivated violence, help to create cultures of peace, justice, and healing for the Earth and all living beings; their relational approach to cultivating peace draws from The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Peacebuilding by John Paul Lederach; poem by Galway Kinnell \n<br /></p>\n"
