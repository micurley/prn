  "content": "<p>Cities around the country have been ravaged by significant numbers of community foreclosures following the mortgage<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nloan scandals of recent years. <br />\nBig banks have been wheeling and dealing these finance contracts, often illegally, to execute fraudulent takings of property or profiteering from servicing fees. <br />\nBut they may now be facing their Achilles Heel with challenges to their ownership by bold government leaders who want to stanch the bleeding of community economic health.<br />\n  Ellen talks with the pioneer of this eminent domain legal stratagem, Prof. <br />\nRobert Hockett of Cornell University, about the legal rationale and the probability of its success in Richmond, CA and elsewhere. <br />\nEllen also reviews notable recent monetary news items and co-host Walt McRee provides an update on news from the world of the public banking movement. <br />\n \n <br /></p>\n"
