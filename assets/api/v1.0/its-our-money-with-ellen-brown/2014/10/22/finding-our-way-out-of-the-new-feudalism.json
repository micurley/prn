  "content": "<p>If a historical marker is needed, we can go back to the Magna Carta to identify the beginning of a populist demand for<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nfairness from oligarchic powers. <br />\nIn the recently completed public bank symposia on West and East Coasts, that call was renewed by participants who met with community leaders and elected officials to explore what needs to happen next to establish local and regional public banks. <br />\nCo-host Walt McRee talks with author, lawyer, playwright, radio commentator and international negotiator Craig Barnes about his views of where things stand now in the struggles for economic fairness and later with PA Project Founder Mike Krauss about the themes and conversations that took place at the “Public Banks for Public Works” symposium in Philadelphia on October 18th.\n<br /></p>\n"
