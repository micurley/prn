  "content": "<p>When economic towers collapse, effects are felt.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIn the case of the recent, sudden and significant drop in oil prices, pain may reverberate around the world as major financial institutions are put at significant risk of failure. <br />\nAnd then there is the fallout from bank failures that become stratagems for global bankers to take new control of countries. <br />\nEllen examines these important developments and talks with Irish political leader Mark Dearey who is actively supporting creation of public banks to help recover from virtual extortion by global bankers. <br />\nAnd co-host Walt McRee talks with economy-reformer Marc Armstrong about his new “Commonomics” initiative that aims to unify citizen activism to protect and support public assets.\n<br />\n <br /></p>\n"
