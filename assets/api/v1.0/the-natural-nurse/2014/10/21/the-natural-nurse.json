  "content": "<p>Host Ellen Kamhi, PhD RN, www.naturalnurse.com, interviews Ann Fonfa.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAnn was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 1993.  Suffering from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, she chose not to take chemotherapy or radiation.<br />\n She opted to use a combination of surgery and Natural therapies to deal with multiple tumors. <br />\n  She used Chinese herbs after an MRI in 1999, followed by an MRI in September 2001 , which showed no evidence of disease.  Ann founded the Annie Appleseed Project to share the information she found in her search for complementary and alternative cancer treatments.  She discovered that what worked as treatment, could often be used in an Integrative way along with conventional therapies.  She is a full-time volunteer Advocate, travels widely to attend conferences and meetings.<br />\n  She mentors other Advocates, and runs a fantastic conference in West Palm Beach annually. <br />\nAnn has served on many committees, does grant reviews, is a Consumer reviewer for the Cochrane Collaboration and delights in giving her point of view. <br />\nContact: Annie Appleseed Project, (561) 749-0084, www.annieappleseedproject.org  , www.facebook.com/AnnieAppleSeedProject   ,\nTwitter@annieappleseed \n<br /></p>\n"
