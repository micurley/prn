  "content": "<p>Ellen Kamhi, PhD , RN. www.naturalnurse.com, interviews Jed Schwartz about HEALTH IS IN YOUR HANDS, Jin Shin Jyutsu. <span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nJed graduated from the University of Maryland’s School of Physical Therapy in 1977, specializing in Pediatric Rehabilitation. <br />\nIn High School Jed became interested in alternative methods to help heal the body and began a journey to discover modalities that he could use to help others. <br />\nIn 1981 he met Mary Burmeister and the Art of Jin Shin Jyutsu. <br />\nHis search had ended and just begun with the Art of Jin Shin Jyutsu. <br />\nThe awaking that the truth lay inside oneself drew Jed to this Art which brought together all of the other studies he had done. <br />\nJed became a practitioner of Jin Shin Jyutsu in 1984 and discontinued his work in Physical Therapy in 1987 in order to commit to a full time study and practice. <br />\nIn 1995 he was selected to be on the faculty of the Jin Shin Jyutsu Inc.<br />\n, and is one of 25 international instructors. <br />\nJed has taught classes in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and New Zealand. <br />\nHe continues to have a full-time Jin Shin Jyutsu practice in New York City and Woodstock, New York. <br />\n Contact: https://www.jsjinc.net\n<br /></p>\n"
