  "content": "<p>Host Ellen Kamhi, PhD RN, www.naturalnurse.com, interviews scientist David Gann.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n David Gann’s scientific career spans over 30 years in scientific, engineering, and management experience as an integral member of numerous scientific teams. <br />\nHe has been successful in developing cutting-edge technologies such as the first ultra-high-density magnetic recording medium for Zwan Magnetics (early 1980’s), which included research into the manufacture of rare-earth magnets. <br />\nDuring the late 1990’s, in conjunction with UCLA, Mr Gann’s began his research into the detection and labeling of nano-sized particles found in homeopathic solutions. <br />\nHe was involved with the Department of Immunology at UCLA researching an isolated particle as a stimulant of T-cells (human immune system), with more than 57 blind studies all demonstrating dramatic significant improvements in immune response. <br />\nMr Gann has organized educational symposiums on crucial environmental issues, including global climate change and nuclear waste cleanup in conjunction with the US Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratories. <br />\nToday we will discuss his new book Double Helix Water. <br />\nContact: www.doublehelixwater.com\n<br /></p>\n"
