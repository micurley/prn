  "content": "<p>Host Ellen Kamhi, PhD RN, www.naturalnurse.com, interviews Mr. Max Popov.\n<!--more-->\nMax is a fitness trainer and scholar of modern yoga. <br />\nHe developed weight-resistance yoga in the late 1980s by applying the teachings of B. <br />\nK. <br />\nS. <br />\nIyengar to the strength-training teachings of famed 1920s Indian bodybuilder K. <br />\nV. <br />\nIyer. <br />\nApplying the wisdom of hatha yoga to weight-lifting exercises, Max Popov’s Weight-Resistance Yoga: Practicing Embodied Spirituality reveals the path to transforming strength-training sessions into a mindful, calm, and meditative yoga practice. <br />\nFully illustrated instructions for 26 weight-resistance exercises offer tips for safely, effectively, and efficiently strengthening the neck, shoulders, arms, torso, hips, knees, and ankles using machines, free weights, and the body itself as resistance. <br />\nGuidelines for becoming fully absorbed in the body’s movements against resistance movements made within stillness and stability and coordinated with rhythmic breathing point the way to performing the exercises with tranquility. <br />\nTo support the contemplative state of this practice, Popov includes 20 themed meditations on the embodied experience of performing the exercises.   Contact: www.weight-resistanceyoga.com<br /></p>\n"
