  "content": "<p>The 2015 introductory edition… The theme-of-the-year remains “War”.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe grand unraveling as viewed through the eyes of Japan. <br />\nThe unthinkable amounts of debt jammed into the system by insane central bankers with no possible idea of what they were trying to achieve. <br />\nThis was irrational behavior at its most extreme. <br />\nThe entire edifice must collapse since the debt is totally unpayable. <br />\nJapan is the poster-child of mass irresponsibility by government. <br />\nIt is impossible to analyse the mindset of such incredible, mass stupidity. <br />\nThe entire world is infected. <br />\nThe gravity of all this is unparalleled in all of time. <br />\nCasinos and their future. <br />\nA few words on the TPP which Obama is determined to push through (though no one seems to know why it’s so important to him). <br />\nIt must be stopped.\n<br /></p>\n"
