We examine the importance of work today.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe labor conundrum comes from what is easily the most critical work issue in history. <br />\nThere are no answers. <br />\nLow-paid jobs are usually extraneous to the needs of society. <br />\nYet some high-paid ones are, too. <br />\nWe examine examples of these. <br />\nWe look at how pay scales are devised. <br />\nThe madness of sub-prime auto loans. <br />\nDelinquencies are already soaring in a $1 trillion loan market. <br />\nThe inevitable fallout is going to be catastrophic. <br />\nThe story of a couple of regular people from Texas who moved to Ecuador. <br />\nItâ€™s really not that hard to emigrate! <br />\nHarrowing statistics of child poverty in the United States. <br />\nInvestment traps to avoid while trying to conflate different trends. <br />\nSome words of general advice.\n<br /></p>\n"
