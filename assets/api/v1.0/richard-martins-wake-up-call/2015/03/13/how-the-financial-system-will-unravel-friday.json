  "content": "<p>Debt must always be paid back or reneged upon. There is no other way.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSince the current monumental pile of debt cannot possibly ever be repaid, we must face and understand the process of default. <br />\nI give various scenarios, all of them excruciatingly dire but probable. <br />\nLearn what happens to credit. <br />\nWe follow through how it seizes up, rendering all your credit cards useless overnight. <br />\nYou will have to live with cash. <br />\nAmericans don’t have much of that now. <br />\nThe statistics (quoted here) tell their own story. <br />\nDo not take the status quo for granted. <br />\nIt is about to change in a dramatic way. <br />\nThe absurdity of the lies behind last month’s job figures which were released last week. <br />\nFox news gives America’s “most trusted news coverage”, according to a new poll from Quinnipac University. <br />\nHow the banks were able to doge bankruptcy six years ago and how they continue to do so today. <br />\nSuicide is growing alarmingly in the United States.\n<br /></p>\n"
