  "content": "<p>The underhand, scurrilous way in which the banks passed money over to each other, courtesy of the Fed.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAll taxpayer money for which the taxpayer is ‘on the hook’. <br />\nThe bankers’ desperation has them revisiting the subprime market for even crazier loans than they made ten years ago. <br />\nListen to surreal stories of car loans made for greater than the value of the car and converting them to AAA-rated paper. <br />\nMemories? <br />\nThe Icelandic economy is rebounding despite rogue bankers having been successfully prosecuted and jailed. <br />\nListen to a clip describing this. <br />\nThe economy is showing serious signs of failure. <br />\nHouse prices are soaring despite ordinary people being unable to buy a home. <br />\nThe Healthcare web site STILL doesn’t work eighteen months later. <br />\nWhy we don’t (and won’t) have hyperinflation. <br />\nThe horror story of ill-educated American youth, scoring systematically last or near-last in comparative surveys with other developed countries. <br />\nJournalist “presstitutes”, unwilling to tell the truth for fear of upsetting their sponsors. <br />\nHow their lies affect foreign policy. <br />\nMore on the dissolution of the American Dream.<br /></p>\n"
