  "content": "<p>The emphasis today is on ‘War’.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nWar is the theme of the Wake-Up Call for 2015 and we examine the background and possible prelude to the outbreak of such a war. <br />\nWe look at previous examples of war (Civil War, WW1 &amp; 2) and find similarities in the lead-up to hostilities. <br />\nPossible scenarios to look out for. <br />\nThe use of terrorism ( a straw man, if ever there was one) and fear-mongering by governments to pacify potential trouble-makers who oppose war. <br />\nThe pernicious effects of renewed subprime lending, already ramped up to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.\n<br /></p>\n"
