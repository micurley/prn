  "content": "<p>A close look at student loans.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nStripping away the feel-good repartee, we are left with a system that encourages people to sign up 4.<br />\n5 million more students per year than are capable of earning a degree. <br />\nYes, it’s your money. <br />\nThe loan defaults are going to be epic. <br />\nWe’re talking $250 billion of losses. <br />\nDeleveraging has not happened. <br />\nDebt continues to grow. <br />\nYou must deleverage to solve a crisis caused by excessive debt. <br />\nThe inevitable collapse will be earth-shatteringly horrendous. <br />\nAnother clip from Nigel Farage, this time about the Greek situation. <br />\nUp-coming regulation of the Internet. <br />\nMore on the future disaster ahead for America. <br />\nIceland has dropped its application to join the European Union. <br />\nThe absurdity of the European financial situation. <br />\nCharacterization of the USA.<br />\n: a decomposing corpse of a nation lorded over by a tiny clique of oligarchs who control the herd by wielding Orwellian methods of mind-control.\n<br /></p>\n"
