  "content": "<p>Lee Kuan Yew died a few minutes ago.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAn appreciation of his work in developing Singapore to become the powerhouse it is today. <br />\nAn attempt to unravel the lies and prevarications put about by the Bureau of Labor(ed) Statistics. <br />\nThe 5.<br />\n5% unemployment rate is manifestly a sham. <br />\nA breakdown of the figures shows this cannot possibly be correct. <br />\nIn addition, those with just one hour of employment per week are counted as ‘employed’. <br />\nWe delve quite deeply into the nonsense at the end of which you should, hopefully, be much wiser. <br />\nThe powers-that-be will go to any lengths to hide the brutal reality of a declining America from you. <br />\nAnd when the lying (as in Vietnam) doesn’t work, they invoke other means of stifling dissent. <br />\nThis includes putting pressure on journalists to confirm to the government-inspired, wrong policies, otherwise risking their careers. <br />\nThe futility of higher education and the despair of overqualified applicants for menial jobs. <br />\nThe story of Tesla, a ridiculous concept, funded by politically correct regulated industries. <br />\nIt has a surreal twist<br /></p>\n"
