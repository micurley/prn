  "content": "<p>Today’s guest is Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nDavid Rasnick and he is medical researcher specializing in AIDS, cancer, protease inhibitors and clinical diagnostics. <br />\nHe was the first scientist to synthesis peptidyl-fluoromethanes, inhibitors of cysteine proteases used to destroy tissue related to arthritis, cancer and various parasites. <br />\nIn 1978, he helped establish the Diagnostic chemistry group at Abbott Laboratories and was a founder of Enzyme Systems Products and Prototek. <br />\nAfter leaving Khepri Pharmaceuticals as a senior scientist, David, along with his colleague Dr Peter Duesberg at the University of California at Berkeley, David further developed the aneuploidy theory of cancer, which pertains to chromosomal imbalance. <br />\nOver the years he has been a sharp critic of the current dominant AIDS hypothesis, has been a former President of the group Rethinking AIDS and was a member of the Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel of South Africa started by President Thabo Mbeki.\n<br /></p>\n"
