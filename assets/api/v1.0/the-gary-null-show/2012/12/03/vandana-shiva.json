  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nVandana Shiva is an internationally renowned environmental and  social activist, and was formerly one of India’s top nuclear physicists. <br />\nShe has been credited as the principle founding leader of India’s ecological and ecofeminism movement. <br />\nIn 1982 Dr Shiva founded the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology in New Delhi, which led to the creation of Navdanya (all “a”s are softly pronounced  NAV-DAN-YA) – an organization dedicated to the restoration of organic farming across India and the preservation of indigenous knowledge and culture.\n<br />\nFor several decades, Vandana has fought for changes in the globalized practices of agriculture and food. <br />\nShe has traveled the world speaking against biopiracy of indigenous knowledge by large agricultural and pharmaceutical corporations. <br />\nHer activist efforts have created grassroots organizations throughout the developing world to counter genetic engineering of crops, as well as empower women throughout the third world.\n<br />\nDr Shiva has received numerous international awards, including the Alternative Nobel Prize (the Right Livelihood Award), the UNEP’s Global 500 Award and the UN’s Earth Day International Award.\n<br />\nAmong her more important books are “Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability and Peace”, “Manifestos on the Future of Food and Seed”, and her most recent “Soil Not Oil” Environmental Justice in an Age of Climate Crisis”\n<br /></p>\n"
