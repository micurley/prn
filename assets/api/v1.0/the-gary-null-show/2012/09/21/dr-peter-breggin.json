  "content": "<p>Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal – strategies and dangers\nDr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPeter Breggin has been called the “conscience of psychiatry” during his outstanding career to reform the mental health field. <br />\nDr Breggin is a Harvard trained psychiatrist and a former consultant for the National Institutes of Mental Health. <br />\nHe is one of the harshest critics of current conventional psychotherapeutic approaches in treating mental disorders in both adults and children, particularly the epidemic use of psychoactive drugs. <br />\nAlong with his wife, he is the founder of the Center for the Study of Empathic Therapy, a non profit organization providing scientific-based information on dangers and adverse effects of psychiatric drugs.\n<br />\nDr Breggin has written many important books. <br />\nHis most recent is “Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal: A Guide for Prescribers, Therapists, Patients and the Families” which gives a comprehensive, lay person review of the strategies, stages and symptoms of drug withdrawal.\n<br /></p>\n"
