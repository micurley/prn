  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPeter Breggin has been called the “conscience of psychiatry” during his outstanding career to reform the mental health field. <br />\n Dr Breggin is a Harvard trained psychiatrist and a former consultant for the National Institutes of Mental Health. <br />\nHe is one of the harshest critics of current conventional psychotherapeutic approaches in treating mental disorders in both adults and children, particularly the epidemic use of psychoactive drugs. <br />\n Along with his wife, he is the founder of the Center for the Study of Empathic Therapy, a non profit organization providing scientific-based information on dangers and adverse effects of psychiatric drugs. <br />\nDr Breggin has written many important books. <br />\nHis most recent is “Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal: A Guide for Prescribers, Therapists, Patients and the Families” which gives a comprehensive, lay person review of the strategies, stages and symptoms of drug withdrawal. <br />\nPeter hosts his own broadcast “Dr Peter Breggin Hour” every Wednesday at 4:00 pm eastern on the Progressive Radio Network\n<br /></p>\n"
