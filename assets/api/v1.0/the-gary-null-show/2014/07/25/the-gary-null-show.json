  "content": "<p>The corruption and failure of America’s Foster Care and Child Welfare System\nJoachim Hagopian has been a practicing<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nclinical psychologist and marriage counselor practicing in California for over 25 years, with an emphasis on disadvantaged youth and the child welfare system. <br />\nFor years he has worked with child abuse victims and learning disabilities in diverse settings including residential homes and outpatient clinics.\n<br />\nFrom a Congressional appointment, Joachim attended the US Military Academy at West Point through a Congressional appointment in the late 1960s. <br />\n After clashing with the system he was railroaded out at the end of his third year. <br />\nThis resulted in Joachim filing charges against the academy with failure to allow due process and he won the case in a New York federal district court. <br />\nThis case set the precedent that continues today for cadets the right to present their case and witness before the academy.<br />\n  He eventually completed his education at West Point and served as an officer – many of his classmates now being top high ranking officers in the Department of Defense. <br />\nJoachim’s story is retold in his manuscript book “Don’t Let The Bastards Getcha Down.<br />\n”  In addition he writes on issues about geopolitics, national security and international relations for Global Research, many which have been featured on the Public Radio Network and Boiling Frogs. <br />\nHis articles can be found at GlobalResearch.ca under Hagopian, and his West Point book at RedRedSea.<br />\nnet.\n<br />\n \n <br /></p>\n"
