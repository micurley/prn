  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPeter Gotzsche is a specialist in internal medicine and a co-founder of The Cochrane Collaboration, which was started in 1993. <br />\nHe also established the Nordic Cochrane Center at the University of Copenhagen where he is now its chief physician and researcher and a professor of clinical research design and analysis.<br />\n  Dr Gotzsche has become an international critic of mammography screening and has written extensively on it being scientifically unjustified in peer reviewed literature. <br />\nIn Europe, he is a leading advocate for clinical data transparency within the private and government establishment, and is a voice demanding priority for patient welfare over commercial drug interests.\n<br />\nIn addition to his book exposing the lies behind mammography screening, his most recent release is “Deadly Medicines and Organized Crime: How Big Pharma has Corrupted Healthcare”, one of the most harsh indictments against the Drug industry for selling lies about drugs rather medically proven treatments and cures.<br /></p>\n"
