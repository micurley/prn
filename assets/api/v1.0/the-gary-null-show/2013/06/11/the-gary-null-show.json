  "content": "<p>Continuing discussion on increasing surveillance in America - with Chris Hedges.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Chris Hedges is one of our nation’s most insightful cultural critics, social and political activists and authors. <br />\nFor almost 20 years he was a foreign correspondent in war zones and conflicts in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans, having reported for The New York Times, Christian Science Monitor and other news outlets. <br />\n While at the Times, Chris received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on global terrorism. <br />\nThe same year he received Amnesty International’s Global Award for Human Rights Journalism. <br />\n Over the years he has taught at Columbia, Princeton, NYU and the University of Toronto.\n<br />\nAmong Chris’ many noteworthy books are “American Fascists” (about the fundamental Christian Right), “Empire of Illusion”, and “Death of the Liber. <br />\nHis latest is “Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt”  – a  compelling hard look at the most impoverished regions in the US that have become what Chris calls “sacrifice zones” for the benefit of the  powerful and wealthy\n<br /></p>\n"
