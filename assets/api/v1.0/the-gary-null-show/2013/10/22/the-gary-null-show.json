  "content": "<p>Is our government’s dysfunction actually functional for a premeditated agenda?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nProf.\n<br />\n Norman Pollack is a professor emeritus of history at Michigan State \nUniversity in East Lansing Michigan. <br />\nHe has a long history of engaging \ncivil rights and anti-war activities over the decades, beginning when he\n was 15 and campaigning for Henry Wallace and his Progressive Party in \n1948. <br />\n Later he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson in the 50s and supported \nMartin Luther King. <br />\nA two time Guggenheim fellow, Prof. <br />\nPollack was a \nmajor intellectual voice during the late 60s in giving an knowledgeable \nboost to the New Left and writing on American populism, which became an \npopular documentary “The Populist Mind”. <br />\n After receiving his doctorate \nin American Civilization from Harvard, he taught at Yale and Wayne State\n before going to Michigan. <br />\nIn his later years he has focused on the \nhistory of civil disobedience, socio-political alienation, and the \nsociology of fascism. <br />\nProf. <br />\nPollack currently writes for Counterpunch, \nlooking at the identifying characteristics of America’s descent into a \nnew form of neoliberal fascist state.\n<br /></p>\n"
