  "content": "<p>Today’s guest is Dr. Tim Flannery and he has been considered one of the most famous scientists of our time.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHe is an Australian mammalogist, palaeontologist, ecologist and global warming activist. <br />\nHe was among the first scientists in the world to sound the alarm for tackling the problem of climate change. <br />\nIn addition to his professorship at MacQuarie University, he is also Australia’s first Chief Commissioner for Climate Change. <br />\nHe is believed to have discovered more new species of life than Darwin. <br />\nDr Flannery holds many prestigious positions and posts: the Australian representative for National Geographic, director of Australia’s Wildlife Conservancy, chair of the Copenhagen Climate Council. <br />\nAs an anti-war activist, he is a member of the Soldiers for Peace project to end all wars.\n<br />\nHe was awarded Australian of the Year for his stance on climate change and advocating for the shutting down of coal energy plants – extremely controversial in Australia where the country depends mostly on coal for its energy. <br />\n His writings on climate change and the future of the global environment while offering hope, also are dire warnings.\n<br />\nTim has published well over a dozen books and numerous papers. <br />\nHis most recent book, and perhaps his most all encompassing on a global scale, is “Here on Earth: A Natural History of the Planet.”\n<br /></p>\n"
