  "content": "<p>Today’s guest is Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRichard Francis and he is a freelance researcher and author focusing on the neurosciences, genetics, evolution, environmental issues and the philosophy of science. <br />\nHe has a doctorate in neurobiology and was a research scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford before embarking on a journalism career. <br />\nHe has written for the Ecotraveler’s Wildlife Guides and has published many articles for popular and peer-reviewed journals.\n<br />\nHis recent book is “Epigenetics: The Ultimate Mystery of Inheritance” which best puts into layman terms the rising alternative view on inheritance and DNA function that challenges the conventional determinist theory of genetics that dominates much of biological and medical science today.\n<br /></p>\n"
