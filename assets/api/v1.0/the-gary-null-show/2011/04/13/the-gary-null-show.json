  "content": "<p>Today’s guest is Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRobert Ornstein and he has been a leading pioneer in brain research and deep psychology for over 4 decades. <br />\nWhen we speak of right-left hemisphere brain function, we are in fact referring to the findings of Dr Ornstein’s research. <br />\nIn 1969 he founded the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge which he still directs, and he has been a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford. <br />\nHis later work into the nature of mind and consciousness led to very important books, such as The Evolution of Consciousness, including the introduction of spiritual consciousness in a scientific manner, that led to an entire new direction in psychological practice and was instrumental in bringing spirituality and psychology together.\n<br />\nHis most recent book, co-written with Paul Ehrilich of the Population Bomb fame, and a recent guest on this program, is “Humanity on a Tightrope: Thoughts on Empathy, Family and Big Changes for a Viable Future.\n<br /></p>\n"
