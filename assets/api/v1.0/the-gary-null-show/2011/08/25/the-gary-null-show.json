  "content": "<p>Guest: Susan Lindauer\nSusan Lindauer is a former U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIntelligence Asset who covered anti-terrorism at the Iraqi Embassy in New York from 1996 up to the invasion. <br />\nIndependent sources have confirmed that she gave advance warning about the 9/11 attack. <br />\nShe also started talks for the Lockerbie Trial with Libyan diplomats. <br />\n Shortly after requesting to testify before Congress about successful elements of Pre-War Intelligence, Susan became one of the first non-Arab Americans arrested on the Patriot Act as an “Iraqi Agent.<br />\n” She was accused of warning her second cousin, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Secretary of State Colin Powell that War with Iraq would have catastrophic consequences. <br />\nGratis of the Patriot Act, her indictment was loaded with “secret charges” and “secret evidence.<br />\n” She was subjected to one year in prison on Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas without a trial or hearing, and threatened with indefinite detention and forcible drugging to shut her up. <br />\nAfter five years of indictment without a conviction or guilty plea, the Justice Department dismissed all charges five days before President Obama’s inauguration.\n<br />\nShe is the author of a recent book “Extreme Prejudice: The Terrifying Story of the Patriot Act and the Cover Ups of 911 and Iraq”\n<br /></p>\n"
