  "content": "<p>Guest: Professor Thomas Naylor\nProfessor Thomas Naylor is one of the country’s most independent-thinking economists.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHe is a professor emeritus of economics at Duke University where he has taught since 1964, and is the founder of the Second Vermont Republic — a nonviolent citizen’s network and think tank advocating for the breakup of mega-nations such as the US, Russia and China. <br />\nThe Republic calls for the creation of  small, democratic, affluent, socially responsible nations with a high degree of environmental integrity such as Sweden, Finland and Switzerland. <br />\n  This year Time magazine named the Second Vermont Republic among the world’s top 10 aspiring nations, along with Scotland, Quebec and Kurdistan. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Prof. <br />\nNaylor has written numerous articles in academic and popular publications, including the New York TImes, Christian Science Monitor and The Nation. <br />\nAmong his many books is “Affluenza: The All Consuming Epidemic” (which deals with the illness of over consumption and co-written with John de Graaf who was interviewed and filmed for our forthcoming documentary on poverty in America) and his book “Secession: How Vermont and All Other States Can Save Themselves from Empire”\n<br /></p>\n"
