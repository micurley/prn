  "content": "<p>Days Late, Dollars Short: Are Black Leaders Really Helping Chuy?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAltered State: The Perpetually Surreal Universe of Hillary Clinton\nIt was an impressive show of support for Jesús “Chuy” García, the underdog in Chicago’s volcanic mayoral runoff slated for April 7. <br />\nOn March 9, an array of African American ministers, elected officials, community leaders and businesspeople, the Rev. <br />\nJesse Jackson prominent among them, pledged their troth to Chuy. <br />\nBusinessman Willie Wilson, who placed third in the Feb. <br />\n24 election, followed with his endorsement three days later.\n<br />\nHappy, happy, joy, joy. <br />\nBut are Black leaders really helping Chuy? <br />\nIs there a true coalition effort afoot here to put Rahm “Mr 1 Percent” Emanuel out of Chicago’s misery?\n<br />\nThat she finds herself in the eye of yet another firestorm calling her character, ethics and official conduct into question should be no surprise. <br />\nHillary Clinton, after all, is one-half of the most-often-subpoenaed-and-criminally-investigated couple ever to occupy the White House. <br />\nWith a reported six separate investigations currently in play over a private e-mail account and server she used when she was secretary of state, Clinton finds herself in familiar territory as a target of official inquiry and, possibly, prosecution. <br />\nHer response also is familiar—“I dare you to prove anything you think I did.<br />\n”\nIs she squeaky-clean innocent of all the charges and transgressions that have dogged her all these years? <br />\nOr, is it understood by all, in Hillary Clinton’s perpetually surreal universe, that she in fact is above the law?\n<br /></p>\n"
