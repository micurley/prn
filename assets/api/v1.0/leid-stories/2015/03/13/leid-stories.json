  "content": "<p>Has U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Delivered Justice in Ferguson?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nTwo police officers shot in Ferguson, Missouri, Wednesday as they guarded the Police Department building during an hours-long community protest have been released from hospital and recovering from their wounds. <br />\nRecovery of the embattled town from old and new tensions that bedevil it is not as hopeful.\n<br />\nThe shootings occurred the same day Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned, the latest in a slew of public employees and officials to quit after a US Department of Justice report found and entrenched pattern of racism in the policies and practices of the city’s governing and public-service agencies.\n<br />\nThe DOJ report came with an anti-climactic announcement that no federal charges will be brought against ex-police officer Darren Wilson for shooting to death Michael Brown in on Aug. <br />\n9, 2014—the incident that sparked sustained unrest in Ferguson and sympathetic protests across the country demanding justice in the case.\n<br />\nIn an exclusive series last November, “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />\nMaddox Jr. <br />\npredicted the Department of Justice decision, as well as the Nov. <br />\n24 decision by a county grand jury not to indict Wilson. <br />\nMaddox also predicted that a linked case in Staten Island, NY—the chokehold death of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014—similarly would yield no state indictment of Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo; a grand jury announced Dec. <br />\n3 that it found no reason to indict him. <br />\nHolder promised an “expeditious” federal inquiry into the Garner case the following day. <br />\nResults pending.\n<br />\nThe hunt is on for the shooter(s) of the police officers, the heinous act widely condemned. <br />\nOn Leid Stories, “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />\nMaddox Jr. <br />\npursues answers to the question: Has US Attorney General Eric Holder delivered justice in Ferguson?<br /></p>\n"
