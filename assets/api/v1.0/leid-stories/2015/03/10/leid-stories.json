  "content": "<p>On Being A Woman: Notes on An Evolution\nAll societies exert extraordinary power and influence in shaping not only an<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\naggregate or collective identity, but the individual identity as well. <br />\nSocial “rules”—some of them static, others dynamic—define widely held customs and values, how we relate to each other, and how we see ourselves within the context of the whole.\n<br />\nAmerican society is no exception, even with social rules that are ever shifting and a political and cultural history rooted in race and class ideation and conflict. <br />\nWho decides what the collective identity is, and, consequently, what the individual identity is? <br />\nAnd in this framework, what does being a woman mean?\n<br />\nLeid Stories, in a nod to Women’s History Month, grapples with the question in a fascinating, no-holds-barred personal essay by host Utrice Leid that confronts prevailing views about feminism, gender politics, and racial and cultural supremacy. <br />\n <br /></p>\n"
