  "content": "<p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSets An Agenda with Faith, Hope and Clarity\nLeid Stories commemorates the 86th birthday of Dr Martin Luther King Day Jr. <br />\nwith his prescient analyses of the amalgamated forces of oppression against people of color in the United States and worldwide; his redefinition of the struggle for freedom and equality in America; his relentless pursuit of justice through directed action; his application of the lessons of history; his undiluted pride in being African; and his unshakable faith.\n<br />\nKing transmits all this and more in his speeches today, with vivid instructions to us all about the work still to be done to bring to fruition a just and democratic society.\n<br />\nMainstream media will play its predictable role, projecting King as a “dreamer.<br />\n” King’s blistering polemics, however, informed the thrust of the civil-rights movement, which awakened society, and African Americans especially, to their inherent power.\n<br />\nKing was a beacon, shining a strong light to bring us to safe harbor. <br />\nWhy, then, does it seem that we remain at anchor in a churning sea?\n<br />\n <br /></p>\n"
