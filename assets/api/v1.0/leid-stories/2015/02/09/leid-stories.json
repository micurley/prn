  "content": "<p>The Brian Williams Brouhaha: Lies, Money and Media Hypocrisy\nNBC News anchor Brian Williams is laying low for a while,<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nhoping that an internal probe won’t unearth more of his “misremembered” stories.\n<br />\nBigwigs at NBC are furious that their $10-million-a-year “NBC Nightly News” gatekeeper has tarnished the organization’s “credibility” with at least two stories. <br />\nWilliams said he was in a helicopter in Iraq in 2003 that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. <br />\nAnd he said he saw a body or bodies float by his gang-ravaged French Quarter hotel in the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n<br />\nIraq War veterans and New Orleans emergency officials have called Williams out on both counts, totally disputing Williams’ accounts.\n<br />\nLeid Stories in a commentary dissects the brouhaha over Williams, which provides an excellent opportunity to explore the real issue here: Brian Williams’ lies pale in comparison to the lies routinely told by NBC and corporate media in general.\n<br />\nThe corporate media, however, don’t have a monopoly on lies, warns Leid Stories.<br /></p>\n"
