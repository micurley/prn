  "content": "<p>With No Bus Service, A Detroit Factory Worker Walks 21 Miles Daily to Work;\nBillions in Bankruptcy Bounty: The<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSanctioned Looting of Detroit\nSince 2005, when his 1988 Honda Accord gave out, James Robertson, a 56-year-old factory worker from Detroit, has been walking 21 miles to and from his $10.<br />\n55-an-hour job. <br />\nMost of his off-job time is consumed by his grueling commute. <br />\nThere is no bus service where he lives.\n<br />\nA Detroit Free Press story about Robertson on Sunday went viral. <br />\nIt inspired Wayne State University computer science major Evan Leedy to start a crowdfunding campaign that has raised more than enough money to buy Robertson a car and cover related expenses.\n<br />\nThe story pointed to the nobility and tenacity of Robertson, who has never missed a day or been late for work despite his challenges. <br />\nBut as Leid Stories discusses today, Robertson’s story really is about the level of suffering Detroiters have been coping with in recent years.\n<br />\nTom Barrow, an expert in municipal finance, businessman and former chairman of Michigan’s Board of Accountancy, discusses the relationship between Robertson’s decade-long plight and the orchestrated decline of the City of Detroit that culminated in its historic bankruptcy—at $20 billion, the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history—in 2013, was placed under draconian emergency management by Gov. <br />\nRick Snyder, and, under federal court supervision, saw the transfer of billions of dollars in public and private assets to well-connected banks and corporate interests.\n<br />\nBarrow, president of Citizens for Detroit’s Future, has maintained that Detroit’s bankruptcy was unnecessary and illegal, and a “ruthless” conspiracy to rid the city of its mostly African American population. <br />\nKevyn Orr, the emergency manager appointed by Snyder, has been touting a “reimagined” Detroit. <br /></p>\n"
