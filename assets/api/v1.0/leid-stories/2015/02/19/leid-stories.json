  "content": "<p>Speaking Truth to Power: A Conversation with Vernellia Randall\nRetirement hasn’t slowed down Vernellia Randall.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nQuite the contrary, it has given her a second wind. <br />\nThe former University of Dayton School of Law professor has doubled down on her activist work, “speaking truth to power” (her motto on her website), and “work[ing] continuously at changing the world through law, love and activism.<br />\n”\nRandall, who writes and lectures extensively on race, women’s issues, health care and the law, joins Leid Stories for a wide-ranging conversation about justice in America.\n<br />\nShe is a co-founder of Racial Justice Now, an Ohio grassroots organization of educators, parents, clergy and community activists dedicated to fighting institutional and systemic racism and holding people in power accountable.\n<br />\nApart from her academic accomplishments in law, Randall, a registered nurse, has had an impressive career in public health as an administrator of a statewide public-health program in Alaska. <br />\nShe is the author of Dying While Black, an in-depth look at race-based disparities in US health care.<br /></p>\n"
