  "content": "<p>Hillary Clinton should know a thing or two about handling terrorist attacks on U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nembassies and diplomatic and military personnel abroad. <br />\n It was during her husband’s administration, after all, that Americans first learned about Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda (the first World Trade Center Attack), and US diplomatic and military personnel were the targets of deadly terrorist attacks (Saudi Arabia,  Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, and the shelling of the USS Cole in Yemen).\n<br />\nLeid Stories takes a look at the striking parallels between the Clinton and Obama administrations’ responses to terrorism and the political motives behind them.\n<br />\nAlso, we pause to remember civil-rights icon Lawrence Guyot, co-founder with Fannie Lou Hamer of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, who died on Nov. <br />\n23 after a long illness. <br />\nHe was physically weak when he was on Leid Stories on Oct. <br />\n24, but he insisted on doing the show  because he wanted to speak out about the suppression of voting-rights.\n<br /></p>\n"
