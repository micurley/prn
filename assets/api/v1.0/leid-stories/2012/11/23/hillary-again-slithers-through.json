  "content": "<p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has managed once again to slither through the mud and come out smelling like a rose.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n The battle over the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi somehow has come to rest squarely on the shoulders of UN Ambassador Susan Rice, putting her and President Obama in the crosshairs around her nomination to succeed Clinton, while Clinton racks up political ammunition from her Southeast Asian tour with the president and the Israel-Hamas ceasefire for a possible run in 2016. <br />\nLeid Stories deconstructs how and why Clinton, who has admitted responsibility for security at all US installations abroad and the safety of all workers assigned to them, so far has dodged the bullet on why a US ambassador and four others were killed on Sept. <br />\n11 in Benghazi.<br /></p>\n"
