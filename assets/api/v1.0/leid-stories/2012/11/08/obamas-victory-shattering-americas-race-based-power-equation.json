  "content": "<p>President Barack Obama’s victory at the polls Nov.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n6 is a definitive line of demarcation and departure, not just in American politics, but in the deeply entrenched racist narrative that governs practically all aspects of life in the United States. <br />\n ”Experts” wax philosophic and scientific about why he won, but won’t go so far as to unmask the real reason. <br />\n In a no-nonsense analysis Utrice Leid deconstructs the magic political moment we’re experiencing as a nation, and precisely frames Obama’s victory within the context of America’s age-old — and all-too-familiar — construct of race. <br />\n Obama’s first-term run and second-term victory, she contends, are “trial balloons” for beneficiaries – especially white women and white “ethnics” – who in the heat of battle steered comfortably clear of helping to build the political base he established nationwide, but, as with the civil-rights struggle and others before it, are eager to reap their unearned reward.\n<br /></p>\n"
