  "content": "<p>but, as Leid Stories predicted, she will not be appearing before any congressional committees looking into the Sept.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n11 terrorist attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. <br />\nShe’s still woozy from fainting and hitting her head — even has a doctor’s note. <br />\nBut members of the Accountability Review Board that probed the Benghazi attack will be talking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in closed session today about the State Department’s “systemic failures” and two deputy secretaries of state will testify in a public session before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday about how the State Department is run. <br />\nLeid Stories stays on the case, along with other news stories of the day.\n<br /></p>\n"
