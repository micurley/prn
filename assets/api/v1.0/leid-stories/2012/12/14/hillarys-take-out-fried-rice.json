  "content": "<p>Hillary Clinton, the feminist, winds up her brand-enhancing tenure as secretary of state with a death blow to the<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nascendancy of Susan Rice. <br />\nThere’ll be no climbing on her shoulders. <br />\nBy deftly playing her cards, Clinton landed a choice slot in the Obama administration and now leaves on a high note, nicely poised for a slew of lucrative options, including a 2016 presidential run. <br />\nRice, on the other hand, is left to pick up the pieces of a career shattered by being the face of Clinton’s failure in Benghazi. <br />\nThis, plus “Cliff Notes” (a different take on the so-called fiscal cliff) and listeners’ views on what mattered most this week. <br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
