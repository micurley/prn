  "content": "<p>In the aftermath of the Dec.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.<br />\n, the nation finds itself once again dealing with questions that are hard to answer (Why did it happen? <br />\nCould it have been prevented?) and harder still to ignore (How many more mass killings will it take before something is done to de-escalate America’s homegrown arms race?<br />\n) Official messages of mourning and half-masted flags won’t stop the carnage. <br />\nDecisive action at all levels of government is long overdue.\n<br /></p>\n"
