  "content": "<p>With Gov.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRick Snyder’s signature, Michigan today becomes the second state in the Rust Belt, and the 24th state in the country, to adopt right-to-work statutes. <br />\nUnion opposition was intense, and there was even pressure from the White House and other workers’ rights groups. <br />\nBut is there is deeper meaning to this fight? <br />\nPlus, HSBC’s record $1.<br />\n9 billion settlement with the Justice Department over money-laundering charges points up, once again, the pattern of too-big-to-fail banks going rogue but still being allowed to stay in business.\n<br /></p>\n"
