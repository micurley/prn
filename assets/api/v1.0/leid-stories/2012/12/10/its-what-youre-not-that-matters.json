  "content": "<p>America’s obsession about race has a fairly simple premise: Who and what you think you are aren’t nearly as important<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nas understanding who and what you are not. <br />\n Not white. <br />\n While there is intense interest in whether and to what degree the “Nots” have internalized this premise, scant attention is paid to the fact that whites are having an identity crisis all their own. <br />\nLeid Stories starts that conversation.\n<br /></p>\n"
