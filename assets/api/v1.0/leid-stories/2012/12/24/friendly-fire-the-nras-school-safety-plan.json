  "content": "<p>Leave it to the NRA to solve America’s gun problem with … more guns.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the NRA proposes schools have armed guards (and even administrative personnel and teachers) with firepower to stop mass killers. <br />\nNo need for worrisome debates and legislation, the NRA says, schools can enact their specially-designed counteroffensive right away. <br />\nLeid Stories reads between the lines of the NRA’s plan and deciphers what the gun lobby really wants. <br />\nPlus, updates on what’s not happening in Congress with the so-called fiscal cliff.\n<br /></p>\n"
