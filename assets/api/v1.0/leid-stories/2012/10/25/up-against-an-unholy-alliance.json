  "content": "<p>The Catholic Church and the U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ngovernment have blood on their hands for continuing to support murderous right-wing regimes in Central and South America, says a former US Navy officer and Purple Heart recipient who became a Maryknoll priest and peace activist 44 years ago. <br />\nFather Roy Bourgeois takes on the Vatican for cooperating with repressive regimes in targeting liberation theologists in the region. <br />\n And he is committed more than ever, he says, to shutting down the Fort Benning, Ga.-based US Army School of the Americas (now called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation-WHINSEC) that, since 1946, has been training the military of many developing countries in what he calls “the fine art of repression and terrorism.”\n<br /></p>\n"
