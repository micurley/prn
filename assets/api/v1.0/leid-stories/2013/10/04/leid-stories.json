  "content": "<p>In Georgia, Descendants of Slaves Battle to Hold On to Their Land;\nAcross the Country, ObamaCare Is VoterCare\nA small<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nGullah community of about 30 families living on Sapelo Island, off the Georgia coast, are in a fierce battle with the county government and local land developers to hold on to their ancestral land. <br />\nThe direct descendants of freed slaves who bought their land and settled on the pristine island, they say the county is trying to force them out by hiking their property taxes, even though they receive no county services and are protected by federal law against any land-value increases “that could force removal of the indigenous population.”\nPlus, Leid Stories explores yet another dimension to ObamaCare – targeting African American and Latino communities with the health-insurance rollout, which will “inform” registrants at signup that they can also register to vote and will be “provided with voter registration services.<br />\n”  It is estimated that one-third of uninsured Americans are not registered to vote.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
