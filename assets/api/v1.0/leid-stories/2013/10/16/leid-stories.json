  "content": "<p>Current Fiscal Crisis Is Also A Crisis of Confidence in Government.\nTime for A National Referendum on Congress?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n \nThe fiscal debacle in Washington has proven one thing beyond the shadow of a doubt: Even when the government has shown itself to be continually in breach of the public trust and a threat to the welfare of citizens, said citizens have no real means to stop the abuses heaped upon them or to compel the government to obey their will.\n<br />\n \nLeid Stories discusses the issue of what rights, if any, Americans have to protect themselves against a renegade, intractable government and whether there should be a constitutional provision that certain major pieces of legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act, should require a direct vote (referendum) by the people.<br /></p>\n"
