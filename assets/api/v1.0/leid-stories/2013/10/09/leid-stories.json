  "content": "<p>Between A Rock and A Hard Place: Latinegros in the USA”\nJakiyah McKoy, 7, was crowned Little Miss Delaware on Aug.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n31. <br />\nA month later, she was stripped of the title and crown because pageant officials said she could not prove her Latin heritage.\n<br />\nActually, the sponsoring organization, Nuestras Raices Delaware, caved in to “complaints” that Jakiyah, who is black, “is not the best representative of Latin beauty.<br />\n” A committee is “investigating” Jakiyah’s heritage, since one of the pageant’s rules is that contestants must be “at least 25-percent” Latina.\n<br />\nJakiyah’s story has touched off, once again, a raging discussion about racism and skin politics in the Latino community. <br />\nLeid Stories’ guest, Dr Marta Cruz-Janzen, a longtime scholar of multicultural education, rips the scab off this festering sore in her live presentation, “Between A Rock and A Hard Place: Latinegros in the USA.<br />\n” A Q&amp;A follows.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
