  "content": "<p>Mandela: A Reluctance to Tell the Whole Story\n \nMedia coverage and, therefore, public discourse about and opinion of<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nNelson Mandela, have neatly excised centuries of racist invasion, plunder and brutal subjugation of a people from the story of the heroic figure. <br />\nWe encounter Mandela at the near end of a cataclysmic era in South Africa, but certainly not unique to it. <br />\nThat history had been replicated all over the black world.\n<br />\nLeid Stories discusses the clear discomfort the media and shapers of opinion have in telling the whole story — not the hurried, sanitized version that starts with “apartheid” and casts a centuries-old war for reclamation of indigenous natural rights essentially as a higher-octane version of the US civil-rights struggle that ended with Mandela bringing about kumbaya “reconciliation” in 1994.\n<br />\nThere is a reason they won’t tell the whole story.<br /></p>\n"
