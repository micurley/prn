  "content": "<p>’Tis the Season for . . . A Kinder, Gentler Capitalism?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n \nAs sales calendars go, we’re officially in the holiday season, the time of year when US consumer spending is prodded – by custom and huge advertising budgets — to its peak. <br />\nThe holiday season accounts for between 20 percent and 40 percent of retailers’ annual sales.\n<br />\nDespite the downturn in the economy, the National Retail Federation is predicting that holiday sales will grow by 3.9 percent this year, to $602.<br />\n1 billion. <br />\nHuman misery, but corporate profits.\n<br />\nLeid Stories ponders the theory by Raj Sisodia, a professor of global business, that capitalism can have a heart; it can be a win-win proposition. <br />\nIn fact, he says, several leading companies are proof that “conscious capitalism” works to the benefit of everyone.<br /></p>\n"
