  "content": "<p>The Thrill With Obama Is 62.5% Gone. What’s the Agenda for the Next Three Years?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe first year of his second term completed, it is no secret that the various constituencies that delivered for President Barack Obama — twice — are less than satisfied with the yield on their political investment.\n<br />\nHushed rumbling has now become sharp, open criticism as historically marginalized groups see their standard bearer unable and/or unwilling to engage fully in the battle he had promised to wage in their behalf. <br />\nThere is a palpable sense that he has gone to “the other side” of business-as-usual politics, doing what is expedient rather than what is necessary.\n<br />\nLeid Stories closes the tumultuous year assessing where things stand with the original (2008) and extended (2012) contracts between Obama and his political base, and poses the question: “What’s the agenda – his and ours — for the next three years?”   <br /></p>\n"
