  "content": "<p>If ever there was a reason to absolutely hate America’s two-party system, this is it.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nUsed to be, we could choose between the lesser of two evils and the evil of two lessers. <br />\nNow, even that’s gone. <br />\nTwo utterly wrongheaded political parties, stunningly inept and unsuited for governing, blithely and willfully commit unspeakable acts of economic terrorism against citizens, and not only are allowed to do so in the name of “the democratic process,” but get paid and great bennies to boot! <br />\nThey suffer no real losses if they can’t (or won’t) get it right. <br />\nLeid Stories explains why both parties must be punished at the polls, and why Americans must have more – and better – political choices. <br />\nPlus, economic policy analyst Ethan Pollack discusses what’s what with the Great Sequester.\n<br /></p>\n"
