  "content": "<p>President Barack Obama indeed has been smacked down by the Republicans. No doubt about it.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt’s fair warning that he needs to get his act together. <br />\nBut can he? <br />\nThe president appears to have more political burdens than he reasonably can handle – a continuing checkmate in Congress, a ragtag Cabinet with no sense of direction, budget and economy woes galore, and now, factionalism within the party. <br />\nBut first comes appeasing the Republicans. <br />\nThey’re serving up hefty portions of crow and humble pie, and Obama’s got to eat it.\n<br /></p>\n"
