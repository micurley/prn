  "content": "<p>“Attorney-at-War” Alton H. Maddox Jr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ndiscusses egregious examples of race-based prosecutorial, judicial and official misconduct in several high-profile cases that made defendants of African American victims and plaintiffs of implicated whites, who should have been, and still should be, targets of prosecution.\n<br />\nHe also explains how and why decades-long demands for judicial review of such cases systematically have been ignored or denied.\n<br />\nAll of the cases, says Maddox, have illegal fault lines that produce predictable results and prove over and over again that there are two systems of justice in America—one white, one black, separate and unequal.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
