  "content": "<p>Just yesterday, the City of Chicago declared that it will close 54 schools, giving a last-minute reprieve to four after<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ncommunity protests. <br />\nIt is the first wave of closings in Chicago; Mayor Rahm Emanuel has placed more than 120 in the crosshairs, claiming underutilization and budget issues.\n<br />\nChicago’s fight against school closings is symptomatic of a nationwide pattern, especially in large urban areas, in which the targeted schools are overwhelmingly in poor African American and Latino communities. <br />\nCity administrations cite the same reasons.\n<br />\nLeid Stories sees two parallel motives in school closings – the Obama-supported plan to privatize education, and, locally, politically connected real estate developers who have their eyes on city properties in now-undesirable areas that they can get for a song and then turn into handsome windfalls with inevitable gentrification.\n<br /></p>\n"
