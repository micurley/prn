  "content": "<p>William Blum, who has been chronicling the seamy underside of U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nforeign policy and covert operations since leaving the State Department in 1967, explains why President Obama “could be charged with serious crimes for allowing the United States to fight on the same side as al Qaeda-linked terrorists in Libya and Syria and for funding and supplying these groups.<br />\n”\nAnd yesterday’s congressional hearing on the terrorist attack on the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, last Sept 11 not only revealed entirely different narratives of the tragic event from senior diplomatic staff, but also the surest signal yet of a Republican effort to impeach the president.\n<br /></p>\n"
