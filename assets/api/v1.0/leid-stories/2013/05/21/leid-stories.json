  "content": "<p>Death Throes in Florida/Extreme Labor Pains in Several States: Gov.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRick Scott of Florida has on his desk a piece of legislation, the Timely Justice Act, that prisoner-rights advocates are hoping he won’t sign, but instead will veto. <br />\nThe act speeds up executions, requiring the governor to sign a death warrant within 30 days after a review by the state Supreme Court, and scheduling executions within 180 days. <br />\nMarc Mauer, director of The Sentencing Project in Washington, DC, discusses the enormous impact the legislation would have for 404 death-row inmates in Florida, and the domino effect in other states.\n<br />\nRecent labor statistics are cause for alarm at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute. <br />\nDoug Hall, director of EPI’s Economic Analysis and Research Network, details the devastating effect of unemployment in several key states and the persistence of race as a major factor in the growing numbers of people without jobs.\n<br /></p>\n"
