How Do We Break the Pattern?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nLeid Stories continues the conversation on the Zimmerman verdict, its genesis and its aftermath.\n<br />\nThe jury’s verdict touched off a number of protests nationwide. <br />\nYet, an all-too-familiar pattern is emerging—a flurry of activity in several quarters with established “leaders” at the forefront who have vested interests in maintaining a high profile. <br />\nThis hot-button issue is precisely what they need; it can open doors that have long been shut to them.\n<br />\nHow do we break the pattern of predictable behavior—a lot of noise that soon gives way to deafening silence and inaction? <br />\nThat’s the uncomfortable question Leid Stories poses today.\n<br /></p>\n"
