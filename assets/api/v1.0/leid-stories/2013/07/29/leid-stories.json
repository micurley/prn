  "content": "<p>Showdown in Tallahassee/The Democratic Party’s Notion of ‘Standards’\nFor two weeks now, The Dream Defenders, a group of<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nyoung activists, have camped outside Gov. <br />\nRick Scott’s office in Tallahassee, Fla.<br />\n, insisting that he call a special legislative session to re-examine the state’s “Stand-Your-Ground” law. <br />\nIn a very brief meeting last week, Scott said he would not call a special session, and the camp-in continued. <br />\nLeid Stories gives a report on the status of the protest.\n<br />\nPlus, a pointed question: What does it say about the Democratic Party that it allows the likes of Anthony Weiner (candidate for New York City mayor) and Eliot Spitzer (candidate for New York City comptroller) to run under its banner?\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
