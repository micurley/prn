  "content": "<p>Government In Action Or Government Inaction? The Answer Is … “Yes!\n&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>\n\n<p>It does boggle the mind that the Obama administration and Congress could see merit in energetically pursuing negotiations with “pariah” states like Syria and Iran but can’t themselves come to terms on legislative matters of critical importance to Americans.\n<br />\nThe triangulation of intransigence in the House, the Senate and the White House has impeded progress for almost five years now and, sadly, has become standard operating procedure. <br />\nThis, Leid Stories contends, is not democracy but tyranny—compelling citizens to accept and tolerate governance by people who clearly have developed a virulent resistance to the democratic process.\n<br />\nSo as not to be continual victims of party brinksmanship and legislative gridlock, voters should demand plebiscites on major legislation such as the Affordable Care Act.<br /></p>\n"
