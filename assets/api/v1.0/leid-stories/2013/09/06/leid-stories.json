  "content": "<p>Obama On The Ropes, But Still Itching For A Fight\nThe G20 economic summit wound up its final day in Russia with clear<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nsigns to President Obama not only that America’s political currency is plummeting in value in much of the world, but that the nation is well on its way to being isolated as a warmongering pariah country infatuated with its self-acclaimed superpower status.\n<br />\nOn both counts, the nation’s “Man of Hope” is being held singularly responsible.\n<br />\nG20 reaction to Obama’s itching trigger finger on Syria mirrors that of other world bodies urging an inclusive, diplomatic, nonmilitary solution to Syria’s ghastly civil war. <br />\nYet Obama, with only France as an ally, seems bent on bombs.\n<br />\nThe president, who already has declared his executive power unilaterally to declare war, returns home to press a deeply divided Congress to green-light military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons on its own citizens.\n<br />\nLeid Stories’ listeners discuss the rapidly unfolding Obama drama, its likely consequences, and what, if anything, can be done to compel him to do the right thing.<br /></p>\n"
