  "content": "<p>Driven to Abstraction: The Increasing Uselessness of Ideology\nMost people fervently believe in something or other that<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ninforms their view of the world and how, or if, they fit in it. <br />\nThis is especially true about politics; people tend to have reasonably well-defined ideas about government, political parties, their roles and rights as citizens, etc.\n<br />\nAnd then there are ideologs—people and organizations so utterly obsessed with proving and/or safeguarding the validity of their beliefs that they cannot, and therefore do not, engage in actually applying them. <br />\nWhy? <br />\nMostly because they think no one else believes exactly as they do.\n<br />\nSuch is too often the case, says Leid Stories, with the so-called “left.<br />\n”  Driven to abstraction about the correctness or purity of their ideology, they’ve become inert at a time that action is needed and, increasingly, irrelevant to real-life struggles.\n<br /></p>\n"
