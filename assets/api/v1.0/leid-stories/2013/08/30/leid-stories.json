  "content": "<p>LEID STORIES PROMO — Friday, Aug.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n30, 2013\nHello Casey, here is the promo for Leid Stories today:\nAdvice and Consent: Decision on Syria Points Up Dramatic Difference Between US and Britain on Democracy\nThe British Parliament yesterday (Aug. <br />\n29) rejected a motion by Prime Minister David Cameron to join an allied military strike against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons in rebel strongholds that have killed hundreds of civilians and injured thousands more in a civil war that has been raging since April 2011.\n<br />\nWhat is instructive is the process that produced the vote – a vigorous, free-wheeling open debate, with the prime minister alternatively making his case and being called to account, and with equally vigorous challenges from the opposition and splinter parties.\n<br />\nPresident Obama, his administration and Congress, on the other hand, are contemplating possible US involvement – and have already mobilized the military — behind closed doors, shutting out public scrutiny of the process.\n<br />\nLeid Stories illustrates the difference between government by the people and for the people and government isolated from and insulated against the people.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
