  "content": "<p>How Far Forward?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n 50 Years After the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\nThe conversation begun yesterday continues.\n<br />\nThis is the 50th-anniversary month of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. <br />\nOn Aug. <br />\n28, 1963, more than 200,000 people delivered a demand in person to the government to end political, social and economic apartheid in America. <br />\nTwo landmark pieces of legislation, the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965), grew out of the march, and African Americans began to feel optimistic about a new-found sense of place in American society.\n<br />\nThere is a general sense among Americans today that government is a failing, or failed, institution—either unwilling or unable to erase the same fissures that run deep into America’s landscape. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Leid Stories asks the question: How far forward has the struggle come in half a century?\n<br /></p>\n"
