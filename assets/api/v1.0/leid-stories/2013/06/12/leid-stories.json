Gov’t Is Spying on Citizens?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThat’s Old News to Black Folk!\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>Noted historian, political scientist and author Dr Gerald Horne places the protracted freedom struggle in South Africa in the larger context of similar struggles in the Black world against colonialism, imperialism, fascism and racism. <br />\nIn this perspective, Nelson Mandela is to be seen not as a singular hero (although he does deserve great praise), but as a soldier in the continuum of struggle.\n<br />\nReports last week that the National Security Agency allegedly is mining the databases of major telephone and Internet providers for the communications records of private citizens have caused a torrent of outrage, shock and awe. <br />\nLeid Stories explains it’s been standard operating procedure against African Americans since the days of slavery.<br /></p>\n"
