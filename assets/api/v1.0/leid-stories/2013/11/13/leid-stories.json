  "content": "<p>Are Dems Losing Latino Love Over Immigration?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nBill Rips Obama for Super Fumble on Hillary’s Plan\n \n It’s not being discussed openly, but President Obama’s promise to “reform” immigration laws seems to be written with the same vanishing ink as his assurance that Obamacare enrollees can hold on to their old insurance plans.\n<br />\n \nLouis DeSapio, professor of political science and of Chicano and Latino Studies at the University of California-Irvine, discusses the political state of play between the labor-Latino pro-immigration lobby and the Obama administration and what is likely to happen if there is no decisive movement on reforms soon.\n<br />\n \nAlso, Leid Stories discusses the motivation behind President Clinton’s smackdown of Obama over changes Clinton said should be made to Obamacare rules so that millions can keep the insurance plans they now have.<br /></p>\n"
