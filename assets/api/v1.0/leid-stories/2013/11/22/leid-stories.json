  "content": "<p>Racism: A Psycho-Historical Perspective\n \nThe presidency of John F.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nKennedy, assassinated 50 years ago today, was born in the crucible of dramatic change, both in the United States and all over the world.\n<br />\n Yet, as “liberal” as he is widely portrayed, Kennedy had to be pushed, embarrassed, even threatened, into altering in significant ways, let alone utterly destroying, America’s longstanding racial codas. <br />\nKennedy was no match for racism.\n<br />\nOur guest today, world-renowned scholar Dr Joel Kovel, helps us understand why no US president can “solve” racism. <br />\nIntegrating historical, social and psychodynamic perspectives, Kovel illustrates that racism “is not the simple delusion of a bigoted and ignorant minority, but as a set of beliefs whose structure arises from the deepest levels of our lives — from the fabric of assumptions we make about the world, ourselves and others, and from the patterns of fundamental social activities.”<br /></p>\n"
