  "content": "<p>Post-Election Detroit Resumes Life As A U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nColony\n \n A new mayor, a new City Council, but neither has the power to do much of anything in “colonial” Detroit, under direct management of a state-appointed overseer. <br />\nFor now, democracy is largely a ceremonial exercise – a casualty of a pitched battle between the state and the people that cannot be resolved by committee.\n<br />\n \nDetroit is $18 billion in debt and bankruptcy is the only way to get out of the hole, says Gov. <br />\nRick Snyder. <br />\nWhile it seeks permission from the court to declare bankruptcy – it would be the largest municipal collapse in US history if granted – Snyder has authorized emergency manager Kevyn Orr to call all the shots for day-to-day governance of the city.\n<br />\n \nAbayomi Azikiwe, a community organizer and editor of the Pan African News Wire, explains how post-election life is being lived in the colony.<br /></p>\n"
