  "content": "<p>U.S. Continues to Dishonor Veterans and Those Who Serve the Country\n \nOn April 22, 1971, Lt. John F.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nKerry, wearing his uniform fatigues (he was still a member of the US Navy Reserve), appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to testify about the horrific experiences of soldiers and veterans of the Vietnam War and the urgent need for the US government to change its foreign-policy and military objectives in Southeast Asia.\n<br />\nFor almost two hours he commanded the attention of the committee and the nation with valid criticisms that remain remarkably pertinent today – even though the anti-war dove became quite a hawk in the US Senate (elected in 1985, eventually chairing the same committee before which he testified 14 years earlier) and, currently, as secretary of state.\n<br />\nLeid Stories discusses the many ways in which the Obama administration continues the sad legacy of previous administrations — shortchanging veterans and those who serve their country.\n<br /></p>\n"
