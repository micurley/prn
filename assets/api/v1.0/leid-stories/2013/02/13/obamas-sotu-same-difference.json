  "content": "<p>Yes, it was a different President Barack Obama speaking to Congress and the nation last night. And no, it wasn’t.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nFor, his State of the Union address was both a reiterated wish list of policy “reforms” he’d like attached to his name before he leaves office and a velvet-smooth admission that wily old-guard Republicans, fractured as they are, have beaten him at his own game. <br />\nStill, Obama’s SOTU, crafted in big-picture (not small details) terms, went off as the Hollywood production these things have come to be. <br />\nLeid Stories discusses the pox-on-both-our-houses antidote, offered by Rand Paul (R-KY), whose  stolid Tea Partyesque newspeak was actually refreshing.\n<br /></p>\n"
