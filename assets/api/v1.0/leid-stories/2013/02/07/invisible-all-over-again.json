  "content": "<p>Millions of Americans seem to have disappeared. Gone without a trace, without notice.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSurely such a thing would merit media coverage. <br />\nSurely our commander in chief would make an effort to find them. <br />\nWell, no. <br />\nAnd no. <br />\nLeid Stories explains why the legacy-building, second-term president maintains his political distance with the teeming masses,  selling a narrative his America wants to hear, and why the so-called “liberal” media have taken to their old narrative-without-context ways. <br />\nQuick! <br />\nDust off your copies of Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man!\n<br /></p>\n"
