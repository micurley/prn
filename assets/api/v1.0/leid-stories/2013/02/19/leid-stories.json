  "content": "<p>It’s Open Forum on Leid Stories.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nListeners debate two issues.\n<br />\nAre Republicans on the side of right when they claim a “massive coverup” on Benghazi and therefore entitled to interrupt or obstruct the business of government in pursuit of mere allegations? <br />\nOr, is their way of continuing the do-nothing strategy of Obama’s first term so he would have little to show as accomplishments for his two terms in office?\n<br />\nAnd, in terms of the law, how is Christopher Dorner to be classified, given his actions and his own justification for them in his “manifesto?<br />\n”  Was he mentally impaired by racism? <br />\nIs racism a viable defense for murder? <br />\nWith his “declaration of war” as a former cop against the LAPD, was he an assassin, an enemy combatant, a megalomaniac who felt entitled to take summary action because things did not go his way? <br /></p>\n"
