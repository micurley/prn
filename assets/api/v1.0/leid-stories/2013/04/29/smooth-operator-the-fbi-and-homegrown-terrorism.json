  "content": "<p>In the aftermath of the April 15 Boston Marathon twin bombings, there are more questions than answers—not only about<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nthe shadowy figures said to be the terrorists, but also about the performance of governmental agencies and authorities charged with countering terrorism.\n<br />\nStephen Lendman, a renowned author and research associate at the Center for Research on Globalization, puts the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the microscope in this edition of Leid Stories. <br />\nThe agency, he says, has had, and continues to have, cozy relationships with terrorists, and has been directly implicated in several terror plots.\n<br />\nIt is quite possible, he says, that alleged bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were “set up” to commit the bombings. <br />\n“The official story,” he says, “is full of holes.”\n<br /></p>\n"
