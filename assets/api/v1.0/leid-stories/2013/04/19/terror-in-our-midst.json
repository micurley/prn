  "content": "<p>The Boston Marathon bombings, allegedly by two Chechen nationals, have revived the long-simmering questions: Why?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nWhy us?\n<br />\nThese questions were raised in the aftermath of the Sept. <br />\n11, 2001 attacks by al Qaeda terrorists, who unleashed unspeakable violence on innocent people in the United States. <br />\nThere answers about how they did it, but not why, and not why us.\n<br />\nLeid Stories poses the same questions to listeners today, looking for answers that will help us understand the incongruity of unwarranted violence against unsuspecting people at an athletic event and two young suspects bent on bringing death and grievous injury to them in bomb-bearing backpacks.\n<br /></p>\n"
