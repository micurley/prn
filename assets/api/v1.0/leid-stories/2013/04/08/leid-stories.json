  "content": "<p>So now comes The Budget—the thing that will lay bare President Obama’s true political stripes.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRepublicans having frustrated movement on any of his hot-item “reform” issues—gun control, gender rights and immigration—Obama has been deprived of political victories that would have strengthened his hand in negotiations, if only as evidence that he and the Democrats aren’t losing ground. <br />\nBut there’s trouble, big trouble, brewing. <br />\nHe’s committed to swinging a heavy ax at the budget (which no doubt will anger his base); “compromising” with Republicans (which will cause friction within the party); and selling the idea that we’re all in this together, sharing the pain. <br />\nFolks have already begun singing a different tune: “Hell to the Chief.”\n<br /></p>\n"
