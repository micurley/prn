  "content": "<p>Now is the time.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAmericans are fed up with a political system that has run out of just about everything — integrity, credibility, accountability, even good ideas. <br />\nRepublicans, chastened by defeat, are attempting a makeover; their brand has lost its luster. <br />\nDemocrats, too, realize they’ve lost ground; they’ll be facing off in future contests against a recalibrated GOP. <br />\nTrouble is, there’s little sign of activity in the other-political-party world, even though the time is right. <br />\nIf they don’t get to work soon, visibly organizing their political bases, agendas and strategies, then they deserve to be dismissed as irrelevant.\n<br /></p>\n"
