  "content": "<p>President Obama’s gun-control proposals, which he announced yesterday, are the latest in a series of actions and<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\npolicies that signal what can only be described as disdain for and self-imposed alienation from the African American community, which overwhelmingly delivered victory for him in his two presidential runs. <br />\nIn a searing commentary, Utrice calls Obama out on his repeated dismissal of the interests of blacks, who continue to delude themselves that they have a “friend” in the White House. <br />\nThe president’s plan deliberately ignores what a federal agency calls “an epidemic of homicide” that has been plaguing black communities across the nation — most of the deaths by firearms. <br />\nNo solutions to that!\n<br /></p>\n"
