  "content": "<p>This week finds President Barack Obama at full tilt on the offensive.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSenate Republicans say they will block confirmation of his Cabinet nominees unless they get answers about the terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi. <br />\nThe NRA and pro-gun legislators aim to shoot down his proposals on gun control as the Senate opens hearings on the issue today. <br />\nAnd a campaign-style rally yesterday in Nevada to push for immigration reform hasn’t made it any clearer what, exactly, he’s proposing as legislation. <br />\nLeid Stories puts all three issues in perspective — and before listeners for comment and debate.\n<br /></p>\n"
