  "content": "<p>President Obama today unveils gun-control measures he hopes to enact into federal law — either with the help of a<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nfractured, combative Congress or via executive order. <br />\nEither way, it’s an uphill battle, and it doesn’t help that Gov. <br />\nAndrew Cuomo (D-NY), a 2016 presidential hopeful, has stolen his thunder with “the toughest gun legislation in the country” he signed into law yesterday. <br />\nIn her commentary, Utrice discusses the missing link in the gun-control debate — which, she says, is race-based.\n<br />\nPlus, listeners lock horns with each other in “On Point,” debating the question: “Civil Rights or Human Rights?” <br /></p>\n"
