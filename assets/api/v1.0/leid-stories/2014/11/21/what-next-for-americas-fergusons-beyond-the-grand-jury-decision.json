  "content": "<p>Our discussions this week are a primer on the legal issues involved in a case that has commanded national and<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ninternational attention—the killing of Michael Brown, a young black man, by Darren Wilson, a white officer with the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri.\n<br />\nA grand jury that has been reviewing the case for three months imminently is expected to announce whether it has voted criminal charges against Wilson.<br />\n  But as Leid Stories pointed out, the case has been handled in such a manner that, indictment or no, the officer won’t lose.\n<br />\nToday we discuss the immediate and long-term future. <br />\nWhat use will we make of the many truths learned from our analysis of this case? <br />\nHow will they shape our political consciousness—and, more so, our actions? <br />\nWhat are to be the next moves for the people of Ferguson and for the Fergusons of America?\n<br />\nOur guest, “the people’s attorney general,” Alton H. <br />\nMaddox Jr.<br />\n, frames these questions in the context of the continuum of struggle by blacks for equality and justice. <br />\nListeners contribute their thoughts.<br /></p>\n"
