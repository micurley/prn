  "content": "<p> Ferguson, Missouri, remains a tinderbox of rage and raw emotion after a grand jury announced last night that it found<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nno reason to bring charges against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown on Aug. <br />\n9.\n<br />\nThe grand jury’s decision touched off violent reaction in several areas of the city while President Obama and Brown’s parents called for calm.\n<br />\nLeid Stories’ listeners were prepared for the outcome, having been warned as early as Aug. <br />\n19, just as the grand jury began its probe, that the case was already on the wrong track and heavily weighted against an indictment.\n<br />\nOur guest, “Attorney at War” Alton H. <br />\nMaddox Jr., provides penetrating analysis of the prosecutorial crime scene and discusses why the grand jury’s decision should not be the final word at the state level on Wilson’s culpability.<br /></p>\n"
