  "content": "<p>A tidal wave of self-explanation, self-justification and finger pointing has preceded the imminent announcement of the<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ngrand jury’s decision on whether Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department criminally will be charged with killing Michael Brown and brought to trial. <br />\nIt’s all to blunt criticism or responsibility for missteps in handling the case that might affect the outcome. <br />\nAnd there have been many.\n<br />\nLeid Stories turns its attention today to the biggest missteps in the case—the roles of the Rev. <br />\nAl Sharpton and the lawyers he brought in to represent the family of Michael Brown. <br />\nWhat they did, and what they failed to do, have produced the net result of the case being used to satisfy a number of hidden agendas but not the purported No. <br />\n1 priority of justice. <br />\nThe grand jury’s ruling, whichever way it goes, is linked directly to these missteps.\n<br />\n“The people’s attorney general,” Alton H. <br />\nMaddox Jr., returns to discuss how the actions (and non-actions) of Sharpton and his legal team make them as responsible as the system for impeding the course of justice in Ferguson and in the Fergusons of America.<br /></p>\n"
