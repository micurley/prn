  "content": "<p>Latino Officers Association Leader Takes On PBA, NYPD\nActivists Ignore Mayor’s Plea, Continue Protests in NYC\nThe<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPatrolmen’s Benevolent Association’s rancorous tirades against New York City Mayor William de Blasio crested after two police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were killed by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in an ambush shooting in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.<br />\n “There’s blood on many hands tonight. <br />\nThat blood on the hands starts at City Hall in the Office of the Mayor,” PBA President Pat Lynch, who heads the nation’s largest police union, declared at a news conference after Ramos and Liu were confirmed dead.\n<br />\nTony Miranda, executive chairman of the National Latino Officers Association, says Lynch, seeking reelection as PBA leader, is “out of order” to blame de Blasio for the deaths of Ramos and Liu, and out of sync with the union’s Latino membership.\n<br />\nMiranda discusses these and other salient issues—including the burgeoning nationwide justice movement, racism within the police department, and a pervasive lack of leadership.\n<br />\nFollowing our discussion yesterday on coverage of the tragic event, listeners offer their perspectives on how it has been, and is being, handled by the media, police brass and City Hall.<br /></p>\n"
