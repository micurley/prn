  "content": "<p>Members of the Congressional Black Caucus yesterday entered on the record their views on the controversial Nov.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n24 decision by a grand jury not to indict Darren Wilson, a former police officer with the Ferguson (Missouri) Police Department, for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. <br />\n9.\n<br />\nThe Caucus members, appearing during a Special Order session called at the end of House legislative business for the day, addressed the grand jury’s decision and “what it says about where we are and where we need to go,” said Rep. <br />\nHakeem Jeffries, a congressman from Brooklyn, who chaired the session.\n<br />\nLeid Stories shares their testimony, which consistently pointed to America’s unwillingness to acknowledge and deal forthrightly with its greatest challenge—racism.\n<br />\nSymbolically, they seemed to be speaking to themselves. <br />\nTheir colleagues in the House by then had cleared out of the chamber.<br /></p>\n"
