  "content": "<p>Collector of Bones: For Sharpton Inc., Police Killings Are An Industry (Part 2)\nLeid Stories completes yesterday’s<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ncommentary on how police killings have become a macabre industry for the Rev. <br />\nAl Sharpton and his handpicked group of associates.\n<br />\n“Justice,” the clarion call they regularly sound, is a distant second to their personal and professional interests and agendas; instead, they mine the value of these cases for their own benefit—from plum political connections and lucrative media contracts to getting (via media coverage) a  competitive edge against other lawyers in high-profile police-brutality cases that will yield multimillion-dollar settlements.\n<br />\nSharpton, tutored by the Rev. <br />\nJesse Jackson in the fine art of running with the foxes while hunting with the hounds, is to stage a “March for Justice” in Washington, DC, on Saturday. <br />\nIt is his latest purely symbolic engagement with “the system” and major public-relations effort to affirm himself as a modern-day Martin Luther King Jr. <br />\nand undisputed King of the Blacks.  <br /></p>\n"
