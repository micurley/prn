  "content": "<p>Obama’s SOTU 2014:  Generous Portions of Lame Duck;\nIn his State of the Union address tomorrow, President Obama likely<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nwill revive his oft-repeated theme: “Last year was unnecessarily challenging, and this year will be, too, unless Republicans cooperate with me to get things done.<br />\n” This will be his rationale for cutting back on big-ticket items this election year.\n<br />\nThe truth is, the president has arrived at the first year of his second term with huge political deficits and miscalculations accrued over the last four years — which the Republicans effectively have used to keep him in check. <br />\nObama’s SOTU 2014, therefore, will reflect the chastened president’s new reality: launching any major legislative offensives this year and leading up to 2016 is politically too risky, both for his legacy and the fortunes of the Democratic Party.\n<br />\nObama will pursue an agenda that is expedient and safe. <br />\nThe hurting constituencies that elected him should hold out no hopes that their needs top his list.\n<br />\nLeid Stories listeners express their views.<br /></p>\n"
