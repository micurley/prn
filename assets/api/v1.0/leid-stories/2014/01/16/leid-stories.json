  "content": "<p>Obamacare Faces Major Legal Challenges: Will Pending Lawsuits Sink It?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe contentious Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), off to a wobbly start, is about to come under a series of blistering attacks that, legal experts say, can significantly alter the health-care-reform law if not kill it altogether.\n<br />\nMore than 100 major lawsuits are pending, filed by a wide array of litigants that include public-policy and interest groups, health-care providers, insurance companies and state governments. <br />\nSeveral of these cases will come before the US Supreme Court.\n<br />\nLaw professor Josh Blackman, and expert on the US Supreme Court and author of the recently released Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare, joins Leid Stories for a discussion on the key cases the legal community is watching, the constitutional issues they raise, how they likely will fare at trial, and their potential impact on Obamacare.<br /></p>\n"
