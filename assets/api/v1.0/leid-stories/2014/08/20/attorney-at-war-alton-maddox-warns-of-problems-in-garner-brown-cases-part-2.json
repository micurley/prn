  "content": "<p>Following yesterday’s discussion, Attorney Alton H. Maddox Jr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ndeconstructs the legal issues involved in the police killings of Eric Garner (July 17, Staten Island, NY.<br />\n) and Michael Brown (Aug. <br />\n9, Ferguson, Missouri), and discusses the challenges of assuring just outcomes in such cases, which notoriously are rife with police, prosecutorial and judicial misconduct.\n<br />\nBoth cases already are showing signs of political subversion, Maddox says. <br />\nThis not only could derail justice, but also long-overdue legal reforms.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>A question-and-answer period follows Leid Stories’ interview with Maddox.<br /></p>\n"
