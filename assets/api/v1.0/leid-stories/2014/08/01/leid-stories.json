It’s as if the whole world went mad.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nScary thing is, it looks like more of the same is headed our way next week.\n<br />\nHence, the importance of “Free Your Mind Friday” on Leid Stories. <br />\nThis is the day we decode and share our thoughts about what has happened, and brace ourselves for what’s likely to come. <br />\n \nAdd your own flavor to this zesty intellectual soup with your take on major issues and events. <br />\nOr, fix our gaze on something else entirely. <br />\nIt’s your call; you decide where the conversation ought to go.\n<br />\nCall 888-874-4888 and be heard!<br /></p>\n"
