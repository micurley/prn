  "content": "<p>Leid Stories does this from time to time.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nMuch like having a medical checkup, we take stock of our political consciousness as a way of tracking our understanding and interpretation of our day-to-day reality and how we’re functioning (or not functioning) within it.\n<br />\nUnderstanding informs behaviors and actions. <br />\nSo, ultimately, the point of this exercise is to gauge the impact of our various realities on our thinking and how, in turn, this is affecting our actions in spheres in which we have some type of influence—family, community, organizations, etc.\n<br />\nHow have recent issues and events affected your political consciousness? <br />\nHow has your reality been changed by them? <br />\nWhat new ground have you gained in understanding the way systems work (or don’t work)? <br />\nWhat have you learned about yourself and your ability to make a difference?\n<br />\nNo pat answers here, just an earnest effort at consciousness raising. <br />\nWe learn by genuinely sharing information with each other.<br /></p>\n"
