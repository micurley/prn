  "content": "<p>After Sharpton’s Big Bang In Ferguson, No Answer to Key Question\nA Speech As History: Obama’s Date with Destiny (Part<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n2)\nA month since the Rev. <br />\nAl Sharpton and a coterie of civil-rights “leaders” came to Ferguson, Missouri, to take charge of the incendiary shooting death of college-bound Michael Brown, 18, by Officer Darren Wilson of the local police department, there is neither movement nor an answer to a major—and basic—question: Why has Wilson not yet been arrested?\n<br />\nThis was central to a raucous meeting last night, in which residents of the predominantly African American town faced off with an almost all-white City Council holding its first official meeting since the killing of Brown on Aug. <br />\n9.\n<br />\nLeid Stories again points up Sharpton’s disturbing pattern of “leadership” in high-profile cases (including, most recently, the police chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, NY, on July 17), in which political accommodation appears to trump the quest for justice.\n<br />\nAnd President Obama addresses the nation tonight on his plans for military action against the Islamic State. <br />\nOn many levels, it’s his date with destiny—his presidency and legacy, and author of the role of the United States in the world community of nations—and, in a very real sense, our own.\n<br />\nLeid Stories picks up the conversation from where we left off yesterday, about Obama’s –and our own—point of reckoning. <br />\nThings are about to change again. <br />\nAre we ready?<br /></p>\n"
