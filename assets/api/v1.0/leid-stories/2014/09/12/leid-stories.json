Make Your Speech About the President’s Speech!\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt’s “Free Your Mind” Friday on Leid Stories, when listeners usually take the conversation wherever they want it to go.\n<br />\nToday, though, we’re focusing on President Obama’s address to the nation on Sept. <br />\n10, in which he explained his “strategy” for dealing with the rising insurgency of the Islamic State (formerly the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  (ISIS) and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the Middle East and in other parts of the world. <br />\n \nAs world-class experts on deciphering speeches, we tackle the significance of Obama’s 14-minute, prime-time message, paying particular attention to what was not said (and there was a lot that was not said).\n<br />\nPut your thinking cap on, get your notes in order, and call in with your speech about the president’s speech. <br />\nBe focused and insightful; the entire world is listening to you, waiting to hear your considered opinion.\n<br />\nCall 888-874-4888 and be part of the consciousness-raising collective!<br /></p>\n"
