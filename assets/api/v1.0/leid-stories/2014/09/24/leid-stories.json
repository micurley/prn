  "content": "<p>Russia, China and the Islamic State: The Triple Challenge to U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nForeign Policy\nThis is not President Obama’s finest hour. <br />\nHe’s in the doghouse with Americans on the economy and other major domestic issues, and in the tank on foreign policy. <br />\nHis job-approval ratings are at their lowest since taking office six years ago—a whopping 58 percent giving a thumbs-down on his overall job performance, and only 35 percent approving, according to RealClearPolitics’ latest poll. <br />\nMost industry-standard polls are showing similar numbers.\n<br />\nObama’s often bewildering foreign policies are a main reason, and they continue to haunt him and his administration.\n<br />\nLeid Stories illustrates this point in our discussion today on the triple challenge to US foreign policy—Russia, China and the Islamic State. <br />\nOur guest, scholar and prolific author Dr Gerald Horne, puts Obama’s foreign-policy crises in proper perspective. <br />\n    <br /></p>\n"
