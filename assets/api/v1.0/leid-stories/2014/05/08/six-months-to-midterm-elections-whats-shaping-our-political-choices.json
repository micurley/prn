  "content": "<p>It’s the home stretch for midterm elections and a lot is riding on the outcome. All 435 seats in the U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHouse of Representatives and 33 US Senate seats are up for grabs; the power matrix in 46 state and four territorial legislatures dramatically can be altered; 36 governorships are available; and mayoral races in 28 key cities will determine whether and how life might change for millions of people.\n<br />\nAre voters excited? <br />\nRecent polls are all over the map with regard to voters’ attitudes, which seem as mercurial as news headlines. <br />\nThe political duopoly, however, continues the mad dash for cash, fairly certain that the contest will be between Democrats and Republicans, and the prize will go to the candidate with the most money to sway public opinion.\n<br />\nTwo months since Leid Stories’ last unofficial sampling, we return to the basics. <br />\nHave your political views/consciousness changed; if so, how? <br />\nWhat issues are most important to you now? <br />\nWhat do you see as your political choices in this election year?<br /></p>\n"
