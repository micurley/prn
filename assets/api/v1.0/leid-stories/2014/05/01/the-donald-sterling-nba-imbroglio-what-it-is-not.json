  "content": "<p>Leid Stories has contended from Day 1 that the Donald Sterling-NBA imbroglio is in fact an old sideshow skillfully<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nbeing made to look like a brand-new main attraction. <br />\nThis revamped version quickly identifies “the problem” and assigns blame; gives us a hero (as counterpoint to the villain), who takes resolute action; gives everyone warm and fuzzy feelings about “justice” and “the right thing” being done; and, most importantly, returns life to the good old status quo.\n<br />\nThe awful truth, though, is that it’s all a charade—a cheap, tawdry chapter in the continuing saga of racism in America. <br />\nWorse, the people facilitating it, pliantly playing their roles, will be the biggest losers in this high-stakes drama. <br />\nAnd yet another exquisite opportunity to effect meaningful, longstanding change will be lost to expediency and the unwillingness or inability to see beyond self.\n<br />\nLeid Stories continues its commentary. <br />\nListeners contribute their thoughts.<br /></p>\n"
