  "content": "<p>It’s a constant caveat of Leid Stories’ ongoing media-literacy exercises: Be alert, defensive consumers of information.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPay attention to what’s not being said or shown. <br />\nThe Donald Sterling-NBA debacle is a treasure trove for media literacy, and Leid Stories today begins a series of “classes” based specifically on the issue.\n<br />\nAppropriately, Part 1 concerns the media itself—how and why it has shaped the story the way it has, essentially as a morality tale about an octogenarian billionaire bigot spectacularly “outed” and reaping his just rewards as befits a pariah.\n<br />\nBut what’s missing here? <br />\nWhat’s the truth? <br />\nWhat is it that we really need to know? <br />\nWhat is it that the media won’t tell or show us?\n<br />\nBrace yourself for revelations.<br /></p>\n"
