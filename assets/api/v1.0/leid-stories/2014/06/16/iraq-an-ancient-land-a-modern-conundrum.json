  "content": "<p>President Barack Obama’s wait-and-see on the rapidly evolving crisis in Iraq won’t last the week under intense pressure<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nfrom congressional, military, corporate and media hawks that he “do something”—especially since President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has offered to help Iraq repel the hardline, al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) jihadists waging a brutal military campaign to take over the country.\n<br />\nA war-weary nation cringes at the very real possibility of renewed military engagement, no matter how “limited” the president says it will be.\n<br />\nObama’s in a no-win situation, says our guest, Prof. <br />\nWilliam O. <br />\nBeeman, chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota and a scholar of Middle East studies for almost 40 years. <br />\nHis predecessor, President George W. <br />\nBush, had all but succeeded in the principal objective of his 2003 invasion of Iraq—the disintegration of the oil-rich country and acquisition of its resources. <br />\nWill “help” from Obama finish the job?<br /></p>\n"
