  "content": "<p>America’s Fukushima: The Largest Ecological Catastrophe in U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHistory \nPart 4: A Scientist-Turned-Poet’s “All-Consuming Obsession”\nInvestigative reporter Paul DeRienzo files the fourth installment of a series on an ecological disaster caused by massive contamination from the Hanford Site, a sprawling nuclear-reactor complex on the Columbia River in south-central Washington state.\n<br />\nToday’s guest is 2012-2014 Washington State Poet Laureate Kathleen Flenniken, whose full-length collection, Plume, is a meditation on the Hanford Site and its impact on her home town of Richland, Wash. <br />\nShe began her career as a civil engineer and hydrologist, and worked three years at the Hanford Site. <br />\nFor nearly six years, she wrote almost exclusively about Hanford.\n<br />\nThe still-partially-functioning Hanford Site, built in 1943, was where two-thirds of the nation’s plutonium was manufactured during World War II and the Cold War. <br />\nIt housed the world’s first plutonium-production reactor that produced much of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the nuclear bombs used against Japan. <br />\nBut the operation of its nine reactors, phased out between 1968 and 1987, has created the largest ecological disaster in the United States.\n<br />\nDuring those 40-plus years, DeRienzo says, a steady stream of industrial and radioactive waste created by the production of the element was dumped directly into the air, river and ground of the 586-square-mile reservation. <br />\n“Now, the United States is faced with the largest cleanup in history, and little hope that it will totally succeed,” he says.\n<br />\nDeRienzo, working under a Polk Awards journalism grant, presents exclusively for Leid Stories Part 4 of his series, “The Hanford Site: America’s Fukushima.”<br /></p>\n"
