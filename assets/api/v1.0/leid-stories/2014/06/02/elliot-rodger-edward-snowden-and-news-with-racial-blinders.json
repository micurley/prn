  "content": "<p>U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nmedia outlets generally have held to the same story lines in reporting Elliot Rodger’s May 23 killing spree in Isla Vista, Calif.<br />\n, and the most recent developments in the Edward Snowden/NSA saga, triggered by his interview with NBC’s Brian Williams that aired May 28.\n<br />\nThis is no mere coincidence, says Leid Stories. <br />\nIn fact, it underscores three undeniable truths about media today: Whether by default or by design, news organizations are loath to include racial factors in their coverage of stories that clearly contain these news values. <br />\nUnless a story is strictly about race, race will not be part of coverage, no matter how germane it is to the issue.\n<br />\nIn Leid Stories’ ongoing series on media literacy, these two headline-grabbing stories are discussed as barometers of how the media sees its role in a race-based society and why consumers of information should develop alternatives relevant to their needs.<br /></p>\n"
