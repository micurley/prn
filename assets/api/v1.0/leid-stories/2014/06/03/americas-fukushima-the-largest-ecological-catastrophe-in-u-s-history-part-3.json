  "content": "<p>Investigative reporter Paul DeRienzo files the third installment of a series on an ecological disaster caused by<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nmassive contamination from the Hanford Site, a sprawling nuclear-reactor complex on the Columbia River in south-central Washington state.\n<br />\nToday’s program focuses on the construction and operation of the N Reactor, the last of nine plutonium-production reactors built at Hanford for the nation’s defense program. <br />\nDesigned also to produce electricity, it became the only dual-purpose reactor in the country. <br />\nWhen it was shut down after 24 years of operation (1963-1987), 1 million gallons of contaminated water and irradiated fuel rods used during production became part of the massive environmental disaster that persists today.\n<br />\nThe still-partially-functioning Hanford Site, built in 1943, was where two-thirds of the nation’s plutonium was manufactured during World War II and the Cold War. <br />\nIt housed the world’s first plutonium-production reactor that produced much of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the nuclear bombs used against Japan. <br />\nBut the operation of its nine reactors, phased out between 1968 and 1987, has created the largest ecological disaster in the United States.\n<br />\nDuring those 40-plus years, DeRienzo says, a steady stream of industrial and radioactive waste created by the production of the element was dumped directly into the air, river and ground of the 586-square-mile reservation. <br />\n“Now, the United States is faced with the largest cleanup in history, and little hope that it will totally succeed,” he says.\n<br />\nDeRienzo, working under a Polk Awards journalism grant, presents exclusively for Leid Stories Part 3 of his investigation: “The Hanford Site: America’s Fukushima.”<br /></p>\n"
