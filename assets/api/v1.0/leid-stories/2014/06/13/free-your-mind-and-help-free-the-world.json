  "content": "<p>It’s Friday.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nOn Leid Stories, it’s when freeing your mind helps to free the world.\n<br />\nMasterfully dissect a major news issue or event, take us through your reasoning, and hear the shackles fall. <br />\nOr, brace yourself for an equally masterful retort. <br />\nEither way, minds are set free, and the doers of such good deeds earn a grand prize indeed—the satisfaction of knowing that they have done honorable trade in the marketplace of opinions and ideas.\n<br />\nNow, live for the weekend and prosper!<br /></p>\n"
