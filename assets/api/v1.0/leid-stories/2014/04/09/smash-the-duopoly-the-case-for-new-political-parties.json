Hundreds of models to choose from.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nLooking for a new suit? <br />\nYou can spend a month just looking at thousands of styles. <br />\nWant to cast a smart vote? <br />\nWell, now you’re in trouble. <br />\nThere’s Party A or Party B. <br />\nPull that lever and rejoice that a whole bunch of people have taken the time to make “democracy” real easy for you.\n<br />\nThe Republican-Democrat duopoly has had a stranglehold on Americans’ political choices for way too long, says our guest, Prof. <br />\nJ. <br />\nDavid Gillespie, author of Challengers to Duopoly: Why Third Parties Matter in American Two-Party Politics. <br />\nThe lack of political-party choices, he says, is not by happenstance; it’s planned that way, he says.\n<br />\nTune in and learn how and why the seismic shift to two-party politics is “the norm;” how fledgling parties were targeted for annihilation; and why it’s important that Americans engage in the formation of new parties that reflect their unique concerns.<br /></p>\n"
