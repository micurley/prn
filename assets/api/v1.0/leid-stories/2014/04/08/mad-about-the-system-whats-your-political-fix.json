  "content": "<p>More and more, American voters are becoming jaded about voting. “Does it change anything?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n they ask—the question that has fueled many a poll showing negative views of politics in general by voters who once thought their participation in the political process actually made a difference.\n<br />\nMidterm elections this year and the looming presidential contest in 2016 seem to have stirred these sentiments again—only with even sharper criticisms about politics and a pervasive view that voters are merely bit players in a complex game that’s all about money and power and they have neither.\n<br />\nLeid Stories asks listeners where on the political axis they place themselves as voters today; what they consider to be the most serious problem with American politics; and what they think a better alternative would be. <br /></p>\n"
