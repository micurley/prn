  "content": "<p>Edward Snowden has said that his motivation for looting an estimated 1.7 million classified  files from the National<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSecurity Agency was to expose the NSA’s indiscriminate, wholesale violations of privacy rights in pursuit of the clandestine interests of the surveillance state. <br />\nHe carefully selected media outlets to tell various aspects of the story based on the files, he said. <br />\nThe London-based Guardian newspaper and contributing reporter Glenn Greenwald were clear favorites.\n<br />\nBut after a few stories that gained international attention came a noticeable lull that was broken by news that Greenwald had struck a $250-million deal with Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire owner of Paypal, a longtime cooperator with the NSA’s data-collection program and, recently discovered, co-funder with the US government of ultraright groups seeking to topple the government in Ukraine. <br />\n Greenwald and a small posse of “leftist” journalists are now employees of Omidyar’s recently launched multimedia venture, First Look Media.\n<br />\nQuestions abound. <br />\nDid Snowden get punked by the person he said he entrusted his classified cache to? <br />\nIs Greenwald a checkbook journalist? <br />\nIs Omidyar now the “owner” of Snowden’s looted files? <br />\nDid Greenwald strike a deal also with the US government to hand over certain files?\n<br />\nAn EyeOpener report by independent commentator James Corbett puts the issue in perspective.<br /></p>\n"
