  "content": "<p>March 4 found Gov.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAndrew Cuomo of New York and an array of elected officials standing behind him in a joyous mood despite the cold. <br />\nLooking out at a sea of about 11,000 schoolchildren, parents and teachers who filled the plaza outside the state Capitol, Cuomo assured them, political-rally style, that they had a friend in Albany; he’ll vigorously defend charter schools against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s threats to limit them.\n<br />\nThe first in a series of discussions about charter schools, Leid Stories takes a look at the recent showdown, which illustrates a number of disturbing but symptomatic aspects of the charter school movement—including the rise of charter schools and the closing of public schools; the targeted populations being overwhelmingly children of color; the relationship between charter schools and community destabilization; and the neoliberal agenda behind charter schools.<br /></p>\n"
