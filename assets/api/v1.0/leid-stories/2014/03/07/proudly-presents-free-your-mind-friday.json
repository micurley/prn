  "content": "<p>Well, here we are, by popular demand, at the premiere of “Free Your Mind Friday!\n&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>\n\n<p>It’s a re-branded, re-scheduled “Open Forum,” but with the same purpose and intent—to be the gathering place for the vigorous exchange of information, opinions and ideas.<br />\n”\nLeid Stories’ listeners had everything to do with it. <br />\nFridays (as opposed to Tuesdays) allow for a review of the week’s major issues, they said, and they liked “Sarah from Dallas”’s idea of having an opportunity to exorcise burdensome thoughts before the weekend. <br />\nMission accomplished on both counts.\n<br />\nSo, free your mind. <br />\nLet’s hear what you have to say about whatever you think is worth [re]considering.  <br /></p>\n"
