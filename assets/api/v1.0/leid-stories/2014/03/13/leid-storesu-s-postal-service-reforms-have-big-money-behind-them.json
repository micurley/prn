  "content": "<p>The U.S.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPostal Service for many years has been the poster child for what’s wrong with “big government.<br />\n” Ever-increasing operational costs, loss of market share and revenue to electronic mail and the private mailing industry, and staggering deficits ($5 billion last year) haven’t helped the USPS any. <br />\nNow powerful forces are behind a push in Congress to institute “reforms” that will have devastating impact on postal workers, consumers and communities across the nation.\n<br />\nThe Senate’s Postal Reform Act of 2014, shepherded by Thomas Carper (D-Del.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) through the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Postal Reform Act of 2013 authored by Darrell Issa (R-Calif.<br />\n), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, are the latest incarnations of a master plan to “right-size” the USPS. <br />\nUnion leaders and the rank and file, understanding what that means, are already in battle mode.\n<br />\nLeid Stories begins a series of discussions on the seamy undersides of the legislative “solutions” to USPS’s woes.\n<br />\nInvestigative reporter Peter Byrne, author of Going Postal: Dianne Feinstein’s Husband Sells Post Offices to His Friends, Cheap, tackles the “solution” to shut down “unnecessary” post offices across the country. <br />\nIt’s a real estate bonanza, he says, and the politically connected have their feet in the door.\n<br />\nRetired letter carrier John Dennie, who two years ago attempted a citizen’s arrest of Postmaster General Patrick R. <br />\nDonahoe for administrative crimes, contends that the government itself engineered USPS’s fiscal crisis. <br />\n   <br /></p>\n"
