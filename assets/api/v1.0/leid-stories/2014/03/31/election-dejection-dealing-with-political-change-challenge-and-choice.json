  "content": "<p>The stakes are high for the Democratic and Republican parties in this year’s midterm elections in which all 435 seats<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nin the US House of Representatives and 33 US Senate seats are up for grabs, and seismic shifts also may occur in 46 state and four territorial legislatures, 36 governorships and 28 mayoral races in key cities.\n<br />\nThis level of political activity would have captured the attention and interest of voters years ago, but not so much now, with polls showing increasing voter distrust, anger and disillusionment with politics and government.\n<br />\nAmong progressives, how are political attitudes changing, and how would these changes affect their political choices in upcoming midterm elections and in the general elections in 2016? <br />\nLeid Stories poses these and related questions to listeners, asking particularly for their own assessment of where in the political spectrum they now place themselves.\n<br />\n <br /></p>\n"
