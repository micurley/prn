  "content": "<p>Why the Ukraine-Crimea Crisis Should Make Us Change Our Politics\nIf nothing else, the Ukraine-Crimea crisis should<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ncause us to re-examine our basic political philosophy and orientation. <br />\nWhy? <br />\nBecause it clearly hasn’t happened at the leadership level; across the board, they’ve run out of good, innovative ideas and new ways of doing things.\n<br />\nLeid Stories raises a number of examples that illustrate the stagnation of progress in many spheres of American life, owing largely to an unwillingness, incapacity or downright refusal to embrace new ideas and realities. <br />\nNo “modern” nation, let alone a “world-leading” one, would tolerate a 2-million-plus prison population, or ninth-place standing in the world on Internet speed, or one-in-seven poverty rates, or would engage in Cold War bloviating and call it diplomacy. <br />\nIn its policy making the United States is its own conundrum, having a futuristic vision of itself that cannot be accomplished with vapid ideas and ways of doing things.\n<br />\nLeid Stories expands on this theme and asks the question: The system is impervious to change. <br />\nWhat, then, are our political choices?<br /></p>\n"
