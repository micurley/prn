Good for you!\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nYou’ve triumphed over the conspiracy to drive you mad with a torrent of “news” and “information” designed mostly to confuse you, throw you off kilter, and dumb you down.\n<br />\nDefend your most precious asset—your facile mind, your ability to think things through!\n<br />\nDisassemble the mishmash we’ve been fed all week and offer instead a pristine analysis of what we really ought to know. <br />\nSay no to mentacide! <br />\nFree your mind!\n<br />\nCall 888-874-4888 and start the process.<br /></p>\n"
