  "content": "<p>Midterm elections 2014 are providing strong clues about where we are as a nation.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nDepending on where locates oneself on the political spectrum, the clues are either assurances that a carefully calibrated system will remain relatively intact, or a harbinger of chaos and doom. <br />\nMiddle ground has all but disappeared.\n<br />\nThose feeling secure, of course, are not worrying about the political choices they will make. <br />\nBut large numbers of those who are worried are caught in an awful bind; theyâ€™re not at all comfortable with the political choices they will make.\n<br />\nConsidering that the Republican-Democratic duopoly will dominate the political choices of most voters, will it also include Progressives and people of color this time around? <br />\nOr, will midterm elections spawn new political activism and movements?\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>If the latter, says Leid Stories, the time has come for no-frills, no-thrills democracy and serious coalition building predicated on eradicating all impediments to freedom, equality and justice.<br /></p>\n"
