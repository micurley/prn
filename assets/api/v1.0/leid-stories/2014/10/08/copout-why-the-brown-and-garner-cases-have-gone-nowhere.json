  "content": "<p>Today marks two months since Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nand almost three months since Eric Garner, 43, died after a violent attempted arrest by a group of police officers during which one of them, Daniel Pantaleo, used an illegal chokehold. <br />\nTo date, no arrest has been made in either case and state and federal probes have yielded no indictments.\n<br />\nLawyers for both men’s families appear to be interested only in the civil side of the case—the huge settlements they expect to get from their wrongful-death claims against both cities. <br />\nMeanwhile, that aspect of the case, which is about justice, is being left to the whims and machinations of the very systems they should be fighting.\n<br />\nThe sexual-assault cloud hanging over one of the Rev. <br />\nAl Sharpton-appointed lawyers, Sanford Rubenstein, did not prevent him from staking an early claim to a portion of the Garner family’s expected wrongful-death payout; he filed a notice of claim for $75 million in court yesterday in behalf of the family.<br /></p>\n"
