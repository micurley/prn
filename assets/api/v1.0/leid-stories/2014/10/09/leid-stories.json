  "content": "<p>Souls to the Polls: The Pimping of the Black Church  \nWe can tell it’s election time.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe news is all about hotly contested races, media networks rake in millions in political advertising, and Black churches are suddenly popular among politicians of all stripes who normally wouldn’t set foot in their would-be voters’ neighborhoods.\n<br />\nThe Democrats have made a science of pimping the Black church, recruiting influential pastors with significant flocks into the party’s fold. <br />\nConsequently, says Leid Stories, the interests and rights of many Black communities across the country are actually being undermined by the very people who should be championing them.<br /></p>\n"
