  "content": "<p>The New Class Warfare: The Oligarchs, the Clerisy and the Yeomanry\nScared Yet?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n Why Obama’s War and Ebola Policy Should Cause Worry\nOut the window with right-versus-left, Republican-versus-Democrat notions of class warfare in America. <br />\nEnter Joel Kotkin, author of The New Class Conflict, who not only gives brand-new meaning to a political lexicon many would think has no relevance today, but blasts away at the common notion of a fixed class structure.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>Kotkin, an internationally recognized authority on global, economic, political and social trends, discusses prospects for progress by the majority under shifting alliances and objectives in the new class conflict.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>Judging by the general tone of the Obama administration, everything is under control. <br />\nSure, a few minor hiccups here and there, but really, there’s no need to panic or go off the deep end. <br />\nNot so sure, says Leid Stories—considering that President Obama’s own advisers appear to be at odds with his things-are-under-control assessment. <br />\nLeid Stories cites two main reasons to worry—the war with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the first manifestations of ebola in the United States.<br /></p>\n"
