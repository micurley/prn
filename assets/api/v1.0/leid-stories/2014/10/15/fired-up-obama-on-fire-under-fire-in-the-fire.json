  "content": "<p>President Obama is having a rough time of it.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nA war that isn’t going his way, a still-stagnant economy, signs of incipient ebola contagion, a combative Congress that won’t play ball, the immigration debacle, militarization of police, and a restive electorate that’s turned off by politics and the political process are some of the reasons he’s getting grayer by the day.\n<br />\nAnti-Obama sentiment is gaining momentum, and for assorted reasons. <br />\nSignificantly, though, in recent months blistering criticisms of him have been coming from people he trusted—former high-level insiders, including Cabinet-level appointees and administration officials—who now openly endorse the contentions of “the other side” about Obama’s leadership and capacity to govern.\n<br />\nLeid Stories asks: Why is this happening? <br />\nWhy is it happening now? <br />\nHow much of this belongs to Obama? <br />\nHow much of it stems from … you know.<br /></p>\n"
