  "content": "<p>Really, Really Sick!\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n Racial Disparities in Health Care (Part 2)\n Concluding her two-part presentation on racial disparities in health and health care, law professor emerita Vernellia Randall (University of Dayton), author of Dying While Black, makes the case that a major impediment in the battle for health and health-care equality in the United States is in the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which, ironically, was enacted to eliminate racial discrimination in all forms.\n<br />\nProfessor Randall explains the problems with the Civil Rights Act and makes recommendations on a law that would close the disparity gap. <br />\nAdditionally, she tackles the contributing problem of “colorblind racism,” focusing particularly on President Obama’s brand of it.\n<br />\nProfessor Randall writes extensively on and speaks internationally about race, women’s issues and health care. <br />\nShe is the recipient of the Ohio Commission on Minority Health Chairman’s Award.<br />\n A public-health professional as well, she administered a statewide health program in Alaska. <br />\nFor the past 15 years, she has focused on eliminating disparities in health care for minorities and the poor.<br /></p>\n"
