  "content": "<p>The IRP6 &amp; the FBI, Chapter 2: A Raid That Really Wasn’t?\n \nOn Feb.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n9, 2005, 21 armed FBI agents without warning swarmed the Colorado City offices of Investigative Resource Planning Solutions (IRP Solutions), a fledgling black-owned software-development company that had created an effective, integrated case-management system for law-enforcement and national-security agencies.\n<br />\nBy then IRP’s Case Investigative Life Cycle (CILC) solution had been getting enthusiastic reviews and, from one agency alone, quote requests for more than $100 million in software support. <br />\nBy then, too, FBI Director Robert Mueller had suffered a humiliating dressing down by a Senate subcommittee for blowing $170 million and more than three years to develop a similar program but had nothing to show for it. <br />\nTestimony by Glenn A. <br />\nFine, the Justice Department’s inspector general, sealed the FBI program’s fate; it was scuttled.\n<br />\nIRP associates Samuel Thurman and Cliff Stewart recall the day of the raid and peculiar things that happened that day that strengthen their belief that sinister motives were behind it. <br />\nIt was, after all, the reason six of the company’s core executives inexplicably were charged with fraud, and why IRP’s promisingly lucrative future came to an ignominious end. <br />\n \nThurman and Stewart are advocates with A Just Cause, which is seeking a Justice Department investigation into the targeting of the IRP6.\n<br />\n <br /></p>\n"
