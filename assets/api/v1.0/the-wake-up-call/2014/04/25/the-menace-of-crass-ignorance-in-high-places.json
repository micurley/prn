  "content": "<p>QE (”quantitative easing”) or money-printing is over.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe evidence comes from Japan but is being admitted almost openly in US financial circles. <br />\nAn abject failure. <br />\nA terrible experiment gone awry. <br />\nAnd its demented creator scurries around the country picking up $75,000 to $250,000 fees for “lecturing” the country. <br />\nListen to a scathing critique from William White, ex-chief economist for the BIS, the central bank of central banks. <br />\n“Freedom” in the US is now relative. <br />\nInnocent until proven guilty? <br />\nNot so much. <br />\nJanet Yellen thinks “full employment” is just around the corner. <br />\nPoor, misguided moron. <br />\nMore on Europe’s problems. <br />\nUtter disillusionment about the political process on the part of the American public.<br />\nThe art of forecasting. <br />\nFamily Dollar and Coldwater Creek bite the dust.\n<br /></p>\n"
