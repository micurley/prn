  "content": "<p>The Federal Reserve, along with every other central bank, is powerless to ignite an economy.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt is peopled by arrogant, second and third-rate economists who have no idea what makes an economy run. <br />\nThey have singularly failed to predict any important financial and/or economic development. <br />\nWe examine what they have done and why it could never have worked. <br />\nYellen is just more of the same. <br />\nIs the Fed really going to buy every single asset on the face of the earth â€“ to prevent it going down in value? <br />\nWhat utter morons! <br />\nA speaker explains why the government can never cut spending. <br />\nStock market comment. <br />\nUnemployment comment. <br />\nThe misery index. <br />\nDollar comment. <br />\nThe future of war in the developed world.\n<br /></p>\n"
