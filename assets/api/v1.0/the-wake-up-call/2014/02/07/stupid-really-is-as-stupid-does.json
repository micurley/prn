Michio Kaku discusses education in America.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAn in-depth look into why and how Americans are stupid. <br />\nWillful ignorance, arrogant cluelessness, self-satisfied obliviousness… all represent the state of unawareness with which Americans lead their lives. <br />\nStudied indifference to the world outside is the only explanation for why Congress gets away with so much fraud and intellectual sloth. <br />\nAnd the media are entirely complicit. <br />\nThe horrendous ignorance surrounding social security has allowed politicians – especially presidents – to ride roughshod over the finances, stealing money and pretending there was a surplus, using the false accounts and then declaring that there was room for tax cuts! <br />\nAmericans never said a word… More on the US ‘pivot’ towards Asia. <br />\nThe case of Germany, seemingly so prosperous but careening towards serious trouble with aging demographics will hurt more and more over the next two decades.<br /></p>\n"
