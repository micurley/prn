  "content": "<p>The simple but basic statistics which the media do not publish or emphasize tell the lie of the ‘economic recovery’.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPlease listen to learn what they are. <br />\nThe Ponzi scheme will terminate because there just isn’t enough money to service the gargantuan-sized debt. <br />\nThere is a finite end to all this, ladies and gentlemen – and we are nearly there. <br />\nMeanwhile, the economy is moribund. <br />\nThe reason for the 5.<br />\n9% rate of unemployment. <br />\nThe introduction of the ‘credit card’ in 1958, the beginning of the most pernicious epoch in all of human economic and financial history.<br />\n  Self-indulged parenting, the norm in America… and why it is so wrong. <br />\nAlibaba is NOT an ‘investment’. <br />\nIt’s a bucket-shop gamble. <br />\nThe scandal of Joan Rivers’s death. <br />\nA few companies are offering “pre-cations”, paid vacations to new hires, to ensure that they come onboard refreshed and ready to work hard. <br />\nThe US Secret Service director resigned after several failures including an armed former felon able to enter an elevator with President Obama. <br />\nAn EU commissioner says the world is facing the most crises since WW2.\n<br /></p>\n"
