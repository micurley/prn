  "content": "<p>The government’s and the media’s desperate efforts to paint lipstick on pigs.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThey claim consumer spending will save the day, conveniently forgetting that the “consumer”has neither money, assets nor borrowing power. <br />\nThis does not stop the powers-that-be trying to coax them into spending money they do not have on things they can ill-afford. <br />\nThese monsters are the drug-equivalent of enablers on steroids. <br />\nThey lie through their teeth and there’s not a damned thing you can do about it (except leave!<br />\n) The current AIG trial. <br />\nWell, well worth reading the transcript. <br />\nIt reads like a detective story. <br />\nYou get a fascinating insight into the mindsets of these government crooks. <br />\nHouston has issued subpoenas demanding pastors turn over any sermons dealing with homosexuality, gender identity or the mayor, lesbian, Annise Parker. <br />\nAnd then there’s the story of the ‘Attack Team’ that roughed up the wrong family, brutalizing and arresting them and then charging them with assaulting police officers. <br />\nThis just might not have happened if they’d been living in, say, Malaysia or Costa Rica. <br />\nAmerica creates its own enemies which is bound to have significant negative effects everywhere. <br />\nSupport for Nigel Farage’s UKIP party in the UK is surging. <br />\nStarbucks baristas have been forbidden to write the names of its customers on its polystyrene cups at a branch near the CIA. <br />\n(Could be outing an agent, you see…)\n<br /></p>\n"
