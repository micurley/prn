  "content": "<p>Does economic progress automatically increase happiness?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThere are ugly studies which show that current levels of happiness are far below those of bygone eras. <br />\nBut no definitive studies have been made in this regard. <br />\nMaterial comforts seem to lead to social disintegration and spiritual emptiness. <br />\nWho can pinpoint the era which enjoyed the highest level of happiness? <br />\nIncreased populations do not necessarily encourage closer friendships: they often lead to increased loneliness. <br />\nEvolution has no interest in happiness. <br />\nIt is only interested in survival and reproduction. <br />\nRecreational drugs are a kind of pathetic way to find happiness. <br />\nHow well do they work?<br />\nÂ  Dentists seem to have the answer to where the economy is headed. <br />\nListen to Jim Rickards talking about deflation and the depression. <br />\nA look at where the economy would be if unnecessary regulations were removed and by how much GDP would consequently increase. <br />\nThe figures are quite sobering.\n<br /></p>\n"
