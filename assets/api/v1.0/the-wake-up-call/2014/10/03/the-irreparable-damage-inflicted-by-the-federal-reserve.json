  "content": "<p>I describe the absurd efforts by the Fed to repair an economy which was always outside its control.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThey have no clue, largely because there is no clue to be had… rather like asking a lathe operator to fly a plane. <br />\nThe Fed does not and never did have the weapons to treat this particular disease. <br />\nA $17 trillion economy is much too complicated to be brought to heel by twelve humans gathering in a room once every few weeks. <br />\nBut, of course, it’s not only that they did not succeed, they did immense damage in the process. <br />\nStock market comment. <br />\nWashington’s problem in having to “roll over” $8 trillion in debt a year. <br />\nProblems with the current dollar rally. <br />\nThe Centre for Economic Policy Research in Geneva debunk the concept of ‘deleveraging’, confirming that there has been virtually none. <br />\nSome of the scandals arising from zero interest rates. <br />\nThe U.<br />\nS government invents terrorist groups and activity to render the population helpless and dependent. <br />\nI present virtual proof of this. <br />\nBernanke was turned down for a refinancing!\n<br /></p>\n"
