  "content": "<p>The story of two politicians arriving late for a plane and being thrown off by the irate passengers.\n<!--more-->\nThe crazy behavior currently seen at a market top: IPOs at ridiculous valuations, excessive risk taken by investors, companies with no earnings being sold at wildly improbable prices and crazy values given to hard assets. <br />\nListen to Nigel Farage on Ukraine and the EU. <br />\nWhat life is like for the very poor. <br />\nThe sobering and horrendous state of Britain today post-Scottish referendum. <br />\nNo hope of recovery in the housing sector. <br />\nOrganisations putting pressure on the Obama Administration to ditch the system of fast-track negotiations, specifically designed to counter the TPA deal with Asia. <br />\nImportant divergences in the stock market. <br />\nAn American who wants to leave the US Workers in China on strike because they didn’t receive mooncakes. <br />\nThe return on investment in a condom.\n<br /></p>\n"
