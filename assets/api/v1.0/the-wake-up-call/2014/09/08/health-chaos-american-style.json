  "content": "<p>The horrors of American healthcare laid bare. The ‘rationale’ for the high prices. Doctors’ incentives.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe history of American health ‘insurance’. <br />\nThe appalling scandal of medical errors which kill between 210,000 and 440,000 patients each year. <br />\nMedical ‘culture’. <br />\nTransportation has its Safety Board. <br />\nWhy not medicine? <br />\nOverprescribing. <br />\nObamacare doesn’t even pretend to cover the entire population. <br />\nMore on unemployment. <br />\n(The percentage of Americans looking for work or working is the lowest in36 years). <br />\nOne lie after another from the government and its mouthpiece, the main stream media. <br />\nSeveral statistics bring the point home. <br />\nAccording to a major new study, people who avoid carbohydrates and eat more fat, even saturated fat, lose more body fat and have fewer cardiovascular risks than people who follow the low-fat diet that health authorities have favored for decades. <br />\nThe Chinese economy is about to implode. <br />\nYou heard it here first!<br />\n  Their financial system is also almost certain to face a fully-blown banking crisis.\n<br /></p>\n"
