  "content": "<p>The deliberate obfuscation of what money and debt are all about. We are reaching the final stage of this folly.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nMore on the framing of Putin over Ukraine. <br />\nThe absurd storyline that the Anglo Saxons accept but widely doubted elsewhere. <br />\nLies, cover-ups, anything will be used to vilify and demonize Putin and punish him for harboring Edward Snowden and preventing the Americans from bombing Syria. <br />\nWashington is locked in permanent war despite having no enemies! <br />\nThe War Party (ie everybody) won the elections. <br />\nWatch them ramp up military spending. <br />\nBrazil looking to evade the US in purchasing IT technology and building cables to Europe. <br />\nThe Economic End Game as explained by Brandon Smith. <br />\nDeteriorating world economic statistics. <br />\nA criticism of the TPP from a Malaysian newspaper, including criticism from within parliamentary circles â€“ just like in DC with Congress, right?.\n<br /></p>\n"
