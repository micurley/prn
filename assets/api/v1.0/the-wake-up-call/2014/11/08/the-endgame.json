  "content": "<p>Sadly, we must accept being at a point that, frankly we had arrived at a while back.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nI held off announcing it because I did want to rest assured that I was giving serious and well-considered information. <br />\nWorld War 3 is now, for me, a certainty. <br />\nThere is no going back. <br />\nI explain why this is so in today’s show with a heavy heart and with a full understanding of the responsibility my words carry, given my following on the Wake-Up Call. <br />\nThe European economy has finally infected Germany whose growth is slowing alarmingly. <br />\nNone of the measures taken by Europe are in any way relevant to the problems of Europe. <br />\nSome detail on why the housing crisis is by no means over. <br />\nIndeed, it is coming back with a vengeance. <br />\nVoters are clearly dissatisfied with the economy and it showed in the polls. <br />\nBut the evidence points to much worse conditions ahead. <br />\nAbsolutely no difference to be expected regardless of who sits in Congress. <br />\nA kind listener chimes in with her ‘questions’. <br />\nIgnore the pundits’ optimism over the economy. <br />\nJust ignore it. <br />\nA 90-year-old man faces jail for feeding the homeless in Fort Lauderdale.\n<br /></p>\n"
