  "content": "<p>The millennials were lied to. They were told that if they did all the right things, they’d achieve the American Dream.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nAnger and frustration are growing. <br />\nThis is a dangerous demographic to mess with. <br />\nAnd, as the saying goes, they ain’t seen nothin’ yet. <br />\nListen to David Stockman trying patiently to make some points against a TV anchor trying to shut him down. <br />\nA review of the Trans Pacific Partnership which we must all fight tooth-and-nail. <br />\nWhen I ask you to send in a complaint to your local congressman, please do so. <br />\nWe did great last year. <br />\nWe can do the same again. <br />\nListen to some of the consequences from a Malaysian journal… because the US ones refuse to cooperate. <br />\nParallels between the false prosperities of 2007 and 2014. <br />\nEerie similarities. <br />\nAnd we all know what happened in 2008. <br />\nMore lies concerning the latest unemployment statistics from the BLS. <br />\nDifferences in economic approach between the US and China… from an article in Forbes Magazine. <br />\nChinese manufacturing slowed in October. <br />\nThe future of the European Union is in serious doubt. <br />\nA new, secret, spy program that can scoop data from your cell phone from overhead aircraft. <br />\nCharming!\n<br /></p>\n"
