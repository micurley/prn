The effects of the harm the Fed has wrought.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe malicious nature of government policy. <br />\nWhat do we call this era: The Great Recession? <br />\nThe Lesser Depression? <br />\nThe Greater Depression? <br />\nNone of the above? <br />\nMF Global customers all made good at 100%. <br />\nMaximum bullishness is always to be found at market tops. <br />\nThis time is no exception. <br />\nThe story of Snapchat, a company used by youngsters to take pictures of their private parts and which (are supposed to) disappear after 15 seconds. <br />\nValue: ten billion dollars! <br />\nIt has no profits, no earnings and no business model. <br />\nA quick deconstruction of ‘the recovery’. <br />\nA severe critique of a NY Times reporter. <br />\nSome advice for the long weekend. <br />\n(Worldly wisdom)\n<br /></p>\n"
