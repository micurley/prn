  "content": "<p>Another very grim bout of foreclosures will start next year for all the same reasons as before.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThis is because the original foreclosure crisis was never solved. <br />\nIt was deferred. <br />\nAnd now come the consequences. <br />\nTransferring money the old way – the American way. <br />\nListen to how things are done elsewhere. <br />\nAnd then put pressure on your bank to come kicking and screaming into the 21stcentury. <br />\nNew home sales fell again (‘unexpectedly’ – don’t they always?<br />\n) in July. <br />\n“It’s a little bit disappointing”, said one economist. <br />\nThe problems of social security revisited with an update. <br />\nSome interesting and revealing background to the troubles in Ferguson.\n<br /></p>\n"
