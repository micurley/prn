  "content": "<p>The American public’s bias against science. Preferred are bumper-sticker simplicities and faith.\n<!--more-->\nPeople read less, watch less news and embrace stupidity. <br />\nLanguage has deteriorated. <br />\nUniversities don’t educate anymore: they train students to get jobs. <br />\nAmericans systematically vote against their own interests through ignorance. <br />\nIt is getting harder to avoid prosecution for laws we break that we’re not even aware of. <br />\nMore evidence against ‘the recovery’. <br />\nDeclines are evident in all areas. <br />\nReal household income has been declining since 2000 and in some cases long before that – except in Washington DC where it hit an all-time high in 2012. <br />\nFederal government excessive spending, perhaps? <br />\nAnalysts are usually wrong in their forecasts. <br />\nThey are all currently bullish and optimistic on the economy. <br />\nSome burgeoning money supply statistics.\n<br />\n <br /></p>\n"
