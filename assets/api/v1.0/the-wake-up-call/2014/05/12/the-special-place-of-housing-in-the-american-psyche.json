  "content": "<p>Housing represents 17-18% of GDP, not including what goes into it.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nNothing the Fed has done has alleviated the appalling situation that obtained after the bubble that ended in 2005. <br />\nSales of existing homes have fallen or the last seven months. <br />\nBuilders are in trouble because they have created a glut of new homes for sale. <br />\nRecord affordability still has not attracted people into them. <br />\nGDP at 0.<br />\n1% growth is not indicative of a recovery! <br />\nInternational trade has collapsed. <br />\nAll that is certain is that nothing is going to help the recovery recover. <br />\nReal estate is built to very different norms in Latin America. <br />\nA word about Richard Fisher, the Federal Reserve’s rebel. <br />\nLawrence Wilkerson, high-ranking whistleblower of the government. <br />\nYellen’s self-imposed ‘inflation target’. <br />\nThe US Post Office: more losses. <br />\n                    \n<br /></p>\n"
