  "content": "<p>The retrenchment of the retail sector presages unmistakably an imminent official recession.\n<!--more-->\nMassive job losses can be expected. <br />\nAnd all the while, the major organs of the media are telling you that all is well… and that a 1 per cent GDP contraction is nothing to worry about and that 3-4% GDP growth will obtain from the second quarter onwards. <br />\nI talk about retail space per inhabitant in the US, far above that of any other country on earth. <br />\nThe adjustment here will be agonizing – most notably in the employment picture. <br />\nThey say 92 million Americans have left the workforce since 2007. <br />\nUnemployment could not possibly be at 6.<br />\n3% if that were the case. <br />\nAnd if the rate were truly at 6.<br />\n3%, retail sales would be far higher. <br />\nCredit card debt has reached an all-time high but is being used for income and real estate taxes, energy costs, food and other necessities. <br />\nMore on the housing crisis.\n<br /></p>\n"
