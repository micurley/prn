  "content": "<p>Brides in China need to “marry up” in all respects.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe real estate bubble there has reached absurd proportions, leading to ghost-towns. <br />\nThe imminent bursting bubble will affect us all. <br />\nIn fact, it may well be the password to introducing the greatest global depression of all time. <br />\nChina will have to withdraw entirely from world trade. <br />\nHowever, its economy will thereafter be over $100 trillion, according to Niall Ferguson, while America sinks even further into self-administered mediocrity. <br />\nPlenty of statistics here to support this contention. <br />\nMore grim news on the housing situation. <br />\nStock market report. <br />\nMore on the economy. <br />\nA touching story about the difference between US and French health care. <br />\nA word about the euro. <br />\nEntrepreneurs who massage animals need a veterinary license in Arizona! <br />\n(But no license needed for humans). <br />\nAnother example of US government arrogance, criticizing China – as usual.\n<br /></p>\n"
