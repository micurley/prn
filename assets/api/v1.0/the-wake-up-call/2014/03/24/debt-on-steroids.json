Debt has soared more than 40% since then.\n<!--more-->\nThere is no evidence that this debt growth has had any positive effect on economic growth. <br />\nIn fact, quite the opposite. <br />\nThe only unanswered question is as to where this enormous expansion in unproductive debt will lead. <br />\nMathematically it is impossible to “outgrow” debt accumulation. <br />\nThe China crisis, the greatest bubble in history. <br />\nChinese subprime lending looks just like the US just before its crisis, according to George Soros. <br />\nThe knock-on effects of the collapse will be felt worldwide. <br />\nThe Chinese are spending more and more to create less and less GDP. <br />\nThe defaults have begun. <br />\nSit back and watch the fun. <br />\nDavid Stockman talking about the absurdities of “tapering” and “QE-this-and-that”. <br />\nStock market report. <br />\nRevisiting Cyprus.\n<br />\n \n<br /></p>\n"
