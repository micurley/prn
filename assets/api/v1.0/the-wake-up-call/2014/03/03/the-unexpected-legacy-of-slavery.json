  "content": "<p>I talk about the economics of slavery and how slavery has contributed immeasurably to the capital assets of the United<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nStates today. <br />\nThe conundrum of the payment of reparations in the United States. <br />\nThe advancement of medical science through slaves and slavery. <br />\nAll kinds of businesses profited from the use of slaves as active collateral. <br />\nWealth and knowledge acquired through slavery is very understated (if stated at all) in the United States. <br />\nStock market comment. <br />\nMargin debt at record highs. <br />\nA word of warning about the big banks. <br />\nBitcoin follow-up comment. <br />\nThe nonsense about a Greek ‘recovery’. <br />\n(Greece now said to be a ‘surplus nation’!)\n<br /></p>\n"
