  "content": "<p>The European Central Bank yesterday announced that they were even taking a key deposit rate NEGATIVE.\n<!--more-->\nIn doing so, they basically acknowledged that everything else they have been trying over the last several years isn’t working. <br />\nThey want you to go out and spend all your money in order to prop up the economy. <br />\nThey want you to borrow money so that you can spend even more. <br />\nThese policies make for very dangerous banking systems as they stuff their books full of idiotic, destructive loans. <br />\nGlobal central banks are fully addicted to the opiate of debt. <br />\nThe Fed now has a balance sheet well into the $4 trillion range. <br />\nThat’s twice the size of California’s annual GDP. <br />\nThere’s no sign of pulling back or “austerity”. <br />\nUS debt is now at $17.<br />\n5 trillion and growing as the country spends more than it takes in. <br />\nPeople do realize that this principal is never going to be paid back. <br />\nThe country’s now paying over $415 billion a year simply on maintaining its debt. <br />\nMore of my views on the economic melt-down (otherwise known as ‘The Recovery’). <br />\nThe collapse of the iron ore market shows the extent of the economic set-back in China. <br />\nComparing the extent of food insecurity in the United States with that of other countries. <br />\nThe war machine cranks on, courtesy of Barack Obama.\n<br /></p>\n"
