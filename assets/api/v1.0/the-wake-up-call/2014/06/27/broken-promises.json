  "content": "<p>An in-depth look into why promises were made by governments in good faith but which can never be met.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nDemographics are responsible as is overwhelming levels of debt and senseless money-printing that have had no economically beneficial effect. <br />\nWar is the natural follow-on, as restless, disgruntled males are ‘put to work’ by their governments, fighting other people. <br />\nA detailed look at how American health care stacks up against that of other countries. <br />\nA number of comparative statistics, the US versus the world. <br />\nLooking at how and why the bailouts have in no sense helped the American public. <br />\nIn 1970 Americans’ debts rarely exceeded their income. <br />\nThe appalling reality that I-Phones could not be made in the United States today even if labor costs were not an issue. <br />\nMore on the derivatives issue. <br />\nThe real purpose behind the issuance of these toxic instruments. <br />\nZero Hedge’s take on the state of Iraq “before-and-after Bush’s Nation Building effort.”\n <br /></p>\n"
