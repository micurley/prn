  "content": "<p>The velocity of money has fallen to an all-time, record low. This means that economic activity is grinding to a halt.\n<!--more-->\nAn all-time record one out of every eight men in their prime working years (25-54) is not in the labor force. <br />\nNo amount of money-printing will bring them back. <br />\nPrinting money is as irrelevant to the problem as creating billions of cans of baked beans. <br />\n(Actually that would be more useful: you can eat the beans but you can’t eat the money). <br />\nI explain why the US is broke. <br />\nThe government is broke. <br />\n“Owing the money to ourselves” is a malicious and spurious lie. <br />\nAll areas of government are insolvent including the Federal Reserve. <br />\nUS debt as a percentage of GDP is getting higher and higher. <br />\nThe situation is desperately critical but nobody can see it because the media cover it up. <br />\nStock market report. <br />\nThe China question. <br />\nThe hypocrisy of that evil and merciless institution: the IMF.\n<br /></p>\n"
