Denial reigns supreme.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nTeens are simply not interested in driving anymore. <br />\nThey prefer technological gadgetry which is almost free and allows them to stay at home. <br />\nThe transformations offered by cars are now passé. <br />\nPeople are returning to live in the cities from the suburbs. <br />\nGas is expensive. <br />\nBicycling is becoming all-the-rage in the big cities. <br />\nEurope is in terrible shape. <br />\nHuge and growing unemployment, massively rising taxes, a double-dip recession (whatever that means), burgeoning debt… More on the specter of war with China. <br />\nThe recklessness of Fed policy. <br />\nPentagon working hand-in-hand with France to spy on the UAE. <br />\nGovernment and Fed policies seem like magic tricks – until people begin to believe them. <br />\nThen they are considered as magic! <br />\nEconomic growth is not achieved through the issuance of debt.<br /></p>\n"
