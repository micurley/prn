  "content": "<p>Quantitative Easing (money-printing) was designed to save the big banks and insurance companies.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt has simply exacerbated the problems. <br />\nIt has led to vast amounts of newly-created derivatives. <br />\nDerivatives now stand at 450 times the size of the mortgage security derivatives that brought the financial system to death’s door in 2008. <br />\nThere is no saving the system this time round. <br />\nThe horror of what is about to hit the system is too monumental to describe. <br />\nEven 99-cent stores are struggling as poor people cannot even afford their wares. <br />\nStories of struggling economies around the world. <br />\nU.<br />\nS retailers are truly on the ropes. <br />\nHousing gives the lie to reports of US recovery. <br />\nAmerica’s swagger in the eastern Pacific region portends deep trouble ahead. <br />\nChina is ramping up to deal with this threat. <br />\nAll this in keeping with my theme-of-the-year: War with China.\n<br /></p>\n"
