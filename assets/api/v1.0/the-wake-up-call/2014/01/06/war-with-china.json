  "content": "<p>My theme for 2014.\n<!--more-->\nI describe the historical underpinnings and the inevitable war as a resentful United States attacks China in a futile attempt to contain it, precisely mirroring Britain’s attack on Germany twice in the twentieth century. <br />\nIt is not a matter of ‘whether’. <br />\nIt is a question of ‘when’. <br />\nCurrent policies are and have been based on a total suspension of consequences for making the wrong decisions. <br />\nWe are about to face those consequences. <br />\nThey cover the entire spectrum of social demographics: from the government  through to the population-at -large: from the richest of the very rich to the poorest beggar on the streets. <br />\nThe consequences will be felt by all.\n<br /></p>\n"
