  "content": "<p>A medley of statistics showing the inability of the economy to gather much strength.\n<!--more-->\nObamacare insurance premiums add an unexpected obstacle to economic recovery, along with rising taxes and interest rates. <br />\nGovernment welfare programs are being cut. <br />\nMonthly statistics are beginning to reflect the onset of a renewed downturn. <br />\nCapitalism has taken a wrong turn in America. <br />\nAmericans have not yet understood this. <br />\nFascism has virtually completed its takeover of the United States. <br />\nThe Fed’s ignorance of what QE can (and can’t) do. <br />\nA Fed governor’s admission of this. <br />\n24 per cent of respondents in a multi-national poll believes that America is the greatest threat to world peace today. <br />\nA corrupt prosecutor to spend ten days in jail for withholding evidence in a trial that wrongfully put a man in prison for 25 years. <br />\nFlute virtuoso loses 13 flutes to the trash courtesy a customs official at JFK who thought they were illegal imported bamboo (an ‘agricultural item’). <br />\nVehicle sales took a severe beating last month.<br /></p>\n"
