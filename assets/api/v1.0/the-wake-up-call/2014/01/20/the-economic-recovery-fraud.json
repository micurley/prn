  "content": "<p>Plenty of statistics here proving incontestably that there is not and has not been any economic recovery.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe heist executed by Bernanke and Hank Paulson in 2008 was the greatest theft ever carried out by humanity. <br />\nIt is impossible to fathom the stupidity of Congress in falling for the scam. <br />\nThey actually rejected the first bill that was presented to them but succumbed a few days later when it was represented with a few mild alterations. <br />\nThe laughable jobs recovery touted by Obama and his sycophantic minions, paid-off economist shills and the discredited corporate media can easily be viewed in graphic form as the false story-line it is. <br />\nStock market update. <br />\nFalsely contived earnings, artificially-inspired future projections, Fed-manipulated inflated asset prices, debts piling on again. <br />\nWhat a rotten system! <br />\nThe virtues of deflation.\n<br /></p>\n"
