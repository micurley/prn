Wilson’s about-turn.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nLike Obama, yet another war president awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. <br />\nWho was it that said, “The world must be made safe for democracy”? <br />\nIdealism, rich in the USA.<br />\n, never misses a beat. <br />\nBernanke’s last day in office. <br />\nWe look at some comparisons between the way the Fed was at the beginning of his tenure and how it is today. <br />\nVery sobering. <br />\nBernanke should be hanging his head in shame. <br />\nThe absurdity of the American mortgage system, courtesy of the Fed. <br />\nNo other country does things the American way. <br />\nIt is totally antithetical to good business practice. <br />\nAnd it all started, like so much else which is rotten in the system, with FDR. <br />\nCorruption in crime labs nationwide, motivating them to turn out results that will be favorable to prosecutors!\n<br />\nA big round of thanks to all of you who wrote/called in to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership. <br />\nIt seems we succeeded. <br />\nThe bill will not be presented for fast-track status. <br />\nYou did it! <br />\nWell done. <br />\nThe nanny state is a powerful reason for you to leave the country. <br />\nThe rules and regulations are becoming intolerable and arbitrary. <br />\nChina’s economy is falling to pieces with a credit market well over 300% of GDP. <br />\nIt’s a bubble. <br />\nFundamental statistics are deteriorating every month now. <br />\nDon’t listen to the polyannas. <br />\nChina’s situation is terminal.\n<br /></p>\n"
