  "content": "<p>The recent oil drop has only happened once before in history.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe unmistakable takeaway from history is that economic activity is slowing down. <br />\nThe concomitant fall in the price of copper equally attests to that. <br />\nListen to the consequences of this decline which are not pretty. <br />\nThey are massively negative. <br />\nLast week’s price collapse really shows us how the economy is doing… how consumer spending is falling… how much poorer people have become as stock markets set records. <br />\nShale is being priced out of the market. <br />\nThe amount of money lost will be stupendous. <br />\nAmerica has hitherto been the hawk when it comes to war declarations. <br />\nPutin is now rising to the challenge. <br />\nThis is very unsettling. <br />\nA word about the unemployment statistics. <br />\nWe go into a lot of detail to show how false and artificial they are. <br />\nTwo Ivy League American professors are roaming the earth trying to encourage anyone who will listen to print more money and bury themselves in ‘stimulus’. <br />\nRogoff even wants to outlaw cash and make every transaction subject to electronic transfers. <br />\nO course, Abe has listened to every word they’ve uttered! <br />\nIf they built a shrine to financial madmen and terrorists in Japan, Rogof and Krugman would be right at the top. <br />\nMoney is nothing more than a medium of exchange. <br />\nIt’s interesting to trace money. <br />\nWhy every boom has to be followed by a bust.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p> <br /></p>\n"
