  "content": "<p>$18 trillion in debt! Yes, we’ve arrived at that figure within the last week.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nExtinguishing some of the lies surrounding this that you will have been told or that you red in the press. <br />\nFailed policies have brought the US to its knees. <br />\nAnd yet, this is only the beginning. <br />\nBernanke’s ‘experiments’ with QE have brought precisely nothing in terms of new wealth. <br />\nThis is terminal. <br />\nThey never discuss the consequences… because they don’t know what to say! <br />\nThe entire project is insane and built on an absurd construct. <br />\nTalking about moving abroad and how to pluck up the courage to do so. <br />\nDerivatives explained through the unfortunatel, real-life application of the oil market. <br />\nThe stock market itself: highly overbought, an accident waiting to happen… yet the stock market goes from strength to strength. <br />\nMore on the debt. <br />\nThe odious Alan Greenspan was interviewed recently and asked  what would happen in the future, His answer: “the central banks have no idea what they’re doing”. <br />\nThat’s a little rich coming from a moron who didn’t know what he was doing either! <br />\nCapitalism has been entirely eviscerated by the Fed and the government.\n<br /></p>\n"
