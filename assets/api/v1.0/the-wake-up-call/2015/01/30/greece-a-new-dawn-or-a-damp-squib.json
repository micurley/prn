  "content": "<p>Letter from the new Prime Minister to a leading German business newspaper. He lays it out fair-and-square.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nA short clip from David Stockman trashing the Fed. <br />\nFeels like I was given the day off! <br />\nThe story behind the brusque realignment of the Swiss currency which broke its parity with the euro last week. <br />\nThis is a very bad omen for the euro. <br />\nThe US is fast losing ground in terms of business startup activity. <br />\nStory of a Chinese man who walked into a bank, opened an account and made a 12 million yuan deposit, only to find that there was no bank. <br />\nThe façade was just a front. <br />\nGiving money to real banks in the west may yet have the same effect. <br />\nYou could lose it all. <br />\nThese banks are mostly insolvent. <br />\nWho cares if they have shop fronts or not? <br />\nRemember, when you deposit money in a bank, you become a creditor of the bank. <br />\nThe money is no longer yours. <br />\nThis is scary – and it should be. <br />\nThe story of the fall of Babylon. <br />\nThis has ugly portends for today.\n<br /></p>\n"
