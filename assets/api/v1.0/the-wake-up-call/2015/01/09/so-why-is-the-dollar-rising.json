  "content": "<p>We approach this discussion by differentiating between ‘taxation regimes’ and ‘money-printing regimes’.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nSimply put, taxation regimes make more money if the country as a whole makes more money through increased wealth creation. <br />\nMoney-printing regimes try to increase their circulation zones since the injection of new money into the system can only be done by the equivalent creation of debt. <br />\nThis has nothing whatever to do with the creation and/or expansion of wealth. <br />\nNo reform of the system is possible without removing the money printers from power. <br />\nMore on the oil melt-down (still in progress). <br />\nThis is not having a positive effect on consumers’ desire to shop. <br />\nConsumer discretionary spending is collapsing. <br />\nThe figures are truly alarming. <br />\nAn analysis of the unemployment report which was published today. <br />\nComparisons of today’s world with that depicted on George Orwell’s book, 1984 which is about a future where the UK descends into a totalitarian regime that’s in a perpetual state of war, propaganda and persecution. <br />\nIt’s all happening!\n<br /></p>\n"
