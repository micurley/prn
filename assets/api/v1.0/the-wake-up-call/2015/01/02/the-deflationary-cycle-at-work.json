  "content": "<p>2015 will be an exceptionally difficult year. A word on why commodity prices have been collapsing (deflation).\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe bubble that preceded the collapse was responsible. <br />\nA painstaking look at several commodities to see how their prices were mercilessly bid up by greedy financiers. <br />\nChina played an overwhelmingly large part in all this with its mad scramble to become the world’s export factory. <br />\nBut given that their massive works projects were a one-time affair, what are they going to do for an encore? <br />\nHow will they unwind their massive debts? <br />\nEconomic war precedes military conflict. <br />\nNo example of economic war supersedes what we see worldwide today. <br />\nThat is why military conflict is certain. <br />\nA quick word on housing and how it relates to shale production. <br />\nA word on why the entire expansion meme is a phony bunch of nonsense. <br />\nThe whole thing is debt-based. <br />\nWithout the infusion of debt there would have been no expansion at all over the last thirty years!\n<br /></p>\n"
