  "content": "<p>There used to be a valid phenomenon known as American Exceptionalism. It is no more. We examine its passing in detail.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe creation of a different entity, freed from prior restraints morphed into the likeness of other nations, including a bland sameness that is the hallmark of American life today. <br />\nMediocrity results. <br />\nMore on war and the seeming obsession that governments seem to have to whip up warlike sentiments. <br />\nIt is all entirely hokey. <br />\nWe have a close look at the falseness of the reasoning behind the security apparatus, etc. <br />\nand what it means to the people in general. <br />\nThe virulent anger and criticisms leveled at Russia seem to have no basis. <br />\nThere is no proof or evidence offered for the crazy assertions of the American government. <br />\nThe European debt situation and the recent Greek elections yesterday and the hopelessness of ‘QE’. <br />\nQuick comment on the State of The Union speech from last week.\n<br /></p>\n"
