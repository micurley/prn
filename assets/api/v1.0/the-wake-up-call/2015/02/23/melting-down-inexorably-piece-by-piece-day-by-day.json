Things have simply got worse.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nI list plentiful statistics in support of this. <br />\nThere is no solution. <br />\nWe have long-since passed the point-of-no-return. <br />\nA kamikaze set of government-inspired, financial suicide policies have been undertaken by governments worldwide, all of which will lead to financial Armageddon. <br />\nI take you on a tour of the US social scene, trying to draw the loose ends together to create a picture of social hell which unavoidably awaits. <br />\nIt is a very grim picture indeed. <br />\nGlobal debt has not ceased to grow since 2007. <br />\nAll major economies have higher levels of borrowing relative to GDP than they had in 2007. <br />\nEntirely and exclusively created and financed by the central banks. <br />\nAll the ‘recovery’ talk is a cruel sham.\n<br /></p>\n"
