Is it because they’re so badly paid?\n<!--more-->\n(In Singapore they receive pay commensurate with their equivalent in the private sector). <br />\nPatterns of warning are showing up and we discuss these. <br />\nAmerica’s infrastructure is now critical. <br />\nMore about ‘happiness’ as discussed in a new study. <br />\nMore bank scandals involving secret bank accounts offshore. <br />\nA new ID document the ‘Internal Passport’ is to be rolled out this summer. <br />\nA book recommendation: Towards A World War III Scenario: The dangers Of Nuclear War by Michel Chossudovsky. <br />\nVery scary but very important and essential reading. <br />\nThe real issue with David Petraeus. <br />\nAnother harrowing story of police brutality (in Philadephia). <br />\nA child suspended from school because he claimed he could play a magic trick on his schoolmate. <br />\nThe horrors of America’s meddling in Ukraine.\n<br /></p>\n"
