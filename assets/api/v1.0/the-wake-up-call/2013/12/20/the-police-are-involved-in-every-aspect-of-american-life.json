Even involving social problems.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nErrant school behavior has become a police issue. <br />\nDriving without a seat belt can easily escalate into an arrest. <br />\nAir travel pat downs. <br />\nSuspicion (justified or not) of drug use. <br />\nEven staying at home can be hazardous. <br />\nAnyone who “looks Latino” is at high risk of being stopped as being potentially ‘undocumented’. <br />\nThe outrage of incarceration in the US It is said the average American commits three felonies a day without being aware of it. <br />\nPoverty and deprivation in the UK How future generations unborn are being robbed today. <br />\nUS households’ net worth at a record high. <br />\nYes but… GDP grow misrepresented as usual.\n<br /></p>\n"
