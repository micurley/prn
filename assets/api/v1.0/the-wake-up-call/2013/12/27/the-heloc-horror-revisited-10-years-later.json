  "content": "<p>HELOCs from before the financial crisis are about to reset to fully amortizing loans.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe figures are astronomical and many – if not most – of those with HELOCs are probably unaware of the huge hikes in monthly payments which await them. <br />\nThe real estate nightmare takes on a new lease of life on January 1. <br />\nMany will simply stop paying and continue to pay the first mortgage. <br />\nThese loans cannot be written down, they must be written off. <br />\nWhat’s so terrible about deflation? <br />\nWhy do governments in a time of crisis always seem to want you to pay higher prices? <br />\nNot to worry, though. <br />\nThey can never win that game. <br />\nSome choice words on the Federal Reserve, 100 years old last Monday. <br />\nEnd-of-year spending continues to drop. <br />\nYoung Americans are certain to enjoy lower living standards than their parents. <br />\nAmerica has lost its moral compass and with it its credibility. <br />\nMore on Las Vegas real estate.<br /></p>\n"
