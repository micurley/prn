  "content": "<p>The market continues to rise solely on the perception that the Fed’s easy money policy can hold stock prices up<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nindefinitely.  Mind you, this is just a perception, nothing more.<br />\n This line of thinking will prove to be no more durable than the dot-com bubble that peaked in early 2000 or the housing bubble that topped out in late 2007. <br />\nMost of the previous major market peaks occurred with the P/E ratio ranging between 18 and 21 times reported cyclically-smoothed GAAP earnings, compared to a norm of 15 times and bear market lows between 7 and 10 times. <br />\nThe current P/E ratio is 20.<br />\n6 times earnings. <br />\nOptimism reigns supreme and an overwhelming number of technical indicators are calling for a massive decline here. <br />\nInvestment advisers were more bearish than in 25 years. <br />\nThe madness of the Fed’s $3.<br />\n2 trillion negative balance sheet. <br />\nThey are truly insane. <br />\nI mean that. <br />\nMore on last week’s monthly unemployment figures. <br />\nThe current state of the economy in two minutes. <br />\nThe latest ramping-up of consumer credit/debt. <br />\nHurricanes and global warming and other nonsense. <br />\nChimpanzees filmed exhibiting jealousy! <br />\n(A lesson for us all).<br /></p>\n"
