  "content": "<p>A new craze: “The Knockout Game”. Stories of gratuitous violence. Brutal and unforgiving attitude of the authorities.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPolice budgets are being cut everywhere. <br />\nThe American game of “Divide-And-Conquer” is being used to forestall social unrest. <br />\nWhat happens when the system collapses entirely? <br />\nCriminals now going after anyone. <br />\nKurt Vonnegut has a word or three for those who believe “paper” is wealth. <br />\nStock market comment. <br />\nThe new (renewed) problem of home equity lines-of-credit and the likely new defaults. <br />\nNobody is talking about this yet – but they soon will be. <br />\nFarmland is probably about to turn down into a vicious multi-year bear market soon. <br />\nA quick profile on Illinois, the third most corrupt state in the nation. <br />\nBritain’s appalling debt problem. <br />\nPersonal debt is almost at a record high. <br />\nThis is not the sign of any recovery; it is the reflection of deep denial.<br /></p>\n"
