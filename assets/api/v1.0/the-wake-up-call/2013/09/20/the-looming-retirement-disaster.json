  "content": "<p>Americans have simply not saved enough for retirement. Pensions are woefully underfunded.\n<!--more-->\nMunicipalities are hurtling towards bankruptcy. <br />\nSocial security is both underfunded and utterly inadequate for survival. <br />\nPlenty of statistics to digest here. <br />\nYoung people already saddled with mountains of debt cannot even begin to save for their own retirement yet they must finance the retirement of the current retirees. <br />\nMeanwhile, food-stamp usage is hitting new all-time records. <br />\nBernanke’s decision to continue flooding the system with useless money. <br />\nDavid Stockman’s pithy comments. <br />\nAutomation hits the restaurant business. <br />\nMass unemployment foreseen among waiters and waitresses. <br />\nComparing the work ethic of ants and humans. <br />\nHow ants use randomness creatively and how humans…don’t! <br />\nSEC ‘special exemptions’ and how they contributed to the crisis. <br />\nEurope’s debt at a record high. <br />\nTiming of the melt-down. <br />\nExponential events versus linear ones. <br />\nMedian household income has been falling sharply for several years. <br />\nThe fiscal crisis in Chicago dwarfs that of Detroit. <br />\nJim Kunstler on the consequences of the Fed’s abusive actions.\n<br /></p>\n"
