  "content": "<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the seriousness of this horror. Debt is the undoing of the United States.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nThe dreadful process of unraveling and deleveraging can no longer be avoided. <br />\nThe consequences will be so invasive to people’s lives that they will rue the day when they ignored my plea for people to leave the United States. <br />\nLife will become truly intolerable: shortages in every area, soaring crime, steeply rising taxes, curtailment of basic civic services, massively rising unemployment, total shut-down of basic freedoms… all these things are going to happen. <br />\nThe truth about the misrepresentation of corporate earnings. <br />\nThe specifics of the decline of the American middle class. <br />\nThe obsession with sports in American schools.\n<br /></p>\n"
