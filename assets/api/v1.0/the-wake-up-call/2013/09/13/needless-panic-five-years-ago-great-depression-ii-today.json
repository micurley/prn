They told us it was Armageddon or TARP.\n<!--more-->\nMany banks would have gone under without TARP but businesses and the consumer wouldn’t have been much affected. <br />\nThey lied to panic Congress into approving the TARP. <br />\nWe never hear about this because to admit that they knew this, the Fed would have to admit that they were just protecting the banks. <br />\nBut it is the truth. <br />\nWe’d almost certainly be enjoying a robust recovery by now. <br />\nThe difference between removing a Stage 1 cancer and letting it metastasize to Stage 4. <br />\nThe national spending deficit soared in August. <br />\nNigel Farage – at it again! <br />\nGlobal Warming returning to Global Cooling! <br />\nAn important aspect of debt that you need to know. <br />\nThe joys of Thailand’s medical system. <br />\nA quick word on inflation. <br />\nThe new World Happiness Report.\n<br /></p>\n"
