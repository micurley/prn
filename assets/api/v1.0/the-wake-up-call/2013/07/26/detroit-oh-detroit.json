  "content": "<p>The pathetic spectacle of a local judge trying to stay the bankruptcy – like trying to outlaw death itself.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nA ghastly moment in American history. <br />\nHow did a country let an entire industry of which it was the undisputed leader slip through its fingers? <br />\nCalling it stupidity hardly does justice to the word. <br />\nIt will take decades to pick up the pieces. <br />\nDetroit is a wake-up call for the entire nation. <br />\nSome historical background. <br />\nThe world debt crisis in perspective. <br />\nEconomic chaos is in our future. <br />\nAn interview with someone who agrees that GDP is an absurd measure of growth (or lack thereof). <br />\nUncanny parallels with 2008 before the melt-down.\n<br /></p>\n"
