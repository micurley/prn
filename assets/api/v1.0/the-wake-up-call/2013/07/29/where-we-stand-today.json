  "content": "<p>A no-holds-barred account of the insanity in which America finds itself today.\n<!--more-->\nThe misplaced belief in its exceptionalism along with generalized crass ignorance and stupidity have allowed the rich and powerful to rape and pillage the country. <br />\nThe frenzied printing of money has ruined the country and continues to do so. <br />\nIt seems nothing can stop the madman at the helm from ramming his ship into iceberg after iceberg in his absurd quest for intellectual vindication. <br />\nA brief explanation as to why there is no growth in the economy. <br />\nIncreased Mexican border protection is just an excuse for preparations to defend the state against future internal civil unrest. <br />\n(Immigration from Mexico has been declining since 2000). <br />\nTeaching English in Brazil: much easier than you might think.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
