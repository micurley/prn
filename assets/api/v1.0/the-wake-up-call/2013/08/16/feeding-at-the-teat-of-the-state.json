  "content": "<p>An account of the novel, 1984 and how it applies to today’s America. Quite unnerving, really.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt’s probably time for a reread (for those of you who’ve already read it). <br />\nA retired Marine colonel expounds on his disgust at how the US police force has become militarized. <br />\nThe problem for the housing market is the sharp decline in mortgage applications, occasioned by higher housing prices and sharply higher interest rates. <br />\nWhy money-printing has failed – and could never have worked despite Bernanke’s assurances to the contrary. <br />\nWhy I believe there to be a 100% chance of a catastrophic meltdown ahead. <br />\nHint: bubbles… Wal-Mart’s bad earnings results just published show an economy in decline. <br />\nThe latest Administration scandal involving Eric Holder and mortgage fraud. <br />\nHealthcare in Singapore. <br />\nThe folly of buying “risk-free” Russian railway bonds before the Russian Revolution.\n<br /></p>\n"
