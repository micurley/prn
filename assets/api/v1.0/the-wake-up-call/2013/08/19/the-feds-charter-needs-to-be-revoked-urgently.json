They have now openly admitted that “QE” didn’t work.\n<!--more-->\nBut the damage is done. <br />\nIt’s too late to save the day. <br />\nI cannot even begin to envisage the way in which the economic and financial horror will unfold. <br />\nThere is no historical parallel for reference. <br />\nAnd yet… the Fed continues to print… and print… and print. <br />\nCan nobody stop these monsters? <br />\nA clip of Thomas Andrews Drake, senior executive of the NSA – and whistleblower. <br />\nThe debt spiral in Japan is careening out of control. <br />\nPromises of a “second-half recovery” each year since 2009 have never materialized. <br />\nYet they continue, this year with the excuse that the sequester ‘cuts’ will ‘wear off’. <br />\nUh huh… A brief word on the housing market and why it will not recover. <br />\nA book recommendation: ‘A Government of Wolves: The Emerging Police State’, by John Whitehead. <br />\nA quick comment on the stock market.<br /></p>\n"
