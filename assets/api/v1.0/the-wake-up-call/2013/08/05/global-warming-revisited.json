  "content": "<p>The opposing view – as espoused by me! I will not rehearse the arguments here.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nYou’ll have to listen to the show for that. <br />\nJust let it be said that overall the planet has not become any warmer since 1998. <br />\nThere was a very slight warming trend between 1976 and 1998. <br />\nBefore that people thought we were headed towards a new ice age! <br />\nFor the ultimate absurdity, please go to Bloomberg.<br />\ncom and type in: ‘Our hotter, wetter, more violent future’, read the article and weep… More on why it is NOT time to buy a house. <br />\nRedefault rates from the HAMP program are at a staggering 46%. <br />\nI truly wonder how long we must wait until the mainstream media describe our current situation for what it is: a depression. <br />\nSpain is taxing sunlight – those who place solar power systems on their rooftops. <br />\nAmerica certainly doesn’t have a monopoly on stupidity.\n<br /></p>\n"
