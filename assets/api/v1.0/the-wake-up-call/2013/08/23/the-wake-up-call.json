  "content": "<p>An account of why productivity has slowed to a crawl and will probably never regain its erstwhile velocity.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nBriefly: the important inventions that make the basics of existence tolerable have already been invented and produced and can never be replicated. <br />\nWe don’t recognize this because of the hubris that insists that today’s “breakthroughs” and “inventions” are far superior to anything that came before. <br />\nWe study the history of industrial development since 1870 and this leads to some very interesting conclusions. <br />\nSome grim and revealing statistics proving beyond any credible doubt that there has been no ‘economic recovery’, despite what you are told. <br />\nThe new and scary US passport application form. <br />\nThe frenzy of new IPO.<br />\ns indicating a high likelihood of a definitive stock market top. <br />\nA brief history of empires that came to ruin, following the same mistaken policies as the United States today.\n<br /></p>\n"
