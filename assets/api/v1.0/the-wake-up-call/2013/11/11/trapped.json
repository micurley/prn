  "content": "<p>An extended talk about the stock market with particular reference to the ridiculous Twitter IPO that came out last<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nThursday. <br />\nThe investing public is yet again, for the third time in thirteen years, becoming trapped at the top of a bubble. <br />\nThe current bubble is in many ways worse than that of the later 90s with the same absurd overvaluations and surreal arguments for growth among companies that have never showed a profit. <br />\nA comment by David Stockman. <br />\nAn update on the economy. <br />\nNoam Chomsky’s comments on foreign appreciation of American antics abroad. <br />\nA short interview with him follows. <br />\nAn account of the Gunpowder Treason plot in London during the 17th century. <br />\nEerie similarities surrounding those events exist today. <br />\nMore on car sales and why they are so strong (hint: subprime auto lending). <br />\nMore evidence the economy is turning down. <br />\nThe pathetic business model of Twitter as compared with the great inventions of the 20th century.<br /></p>\n"
