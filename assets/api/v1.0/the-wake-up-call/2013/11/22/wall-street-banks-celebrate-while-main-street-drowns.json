  "content": "<p>‘Space Available’ looks like a brand-new chain of retail outlets.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt is, of course, becoming the most common sign to be seen in abandoned store fronts in malls across the country. <br />\nExcept for banks which continue to open unneeded branches on street corners nationwide. <br />\nOne third of all bank branches do not make a profit. <br />\nMass closings will be your sign that this ridiculous money-game is over. <br />\nIt will not be long in coming. <br />\nListen to Godfrey Bloom, a Member of the European Parliament and colleague of Nigel Farage, lambast his fellow parliamentarians. <br />\nHousing has probably topped and re-entered its long-term bear market. <br />\nMore evidence that QE does not work. <br />\nYet the Fed continues with the same stupid medicine. <br />\nObama’s empty promises re healthcare. <br />\nGreenspan still writing articles exonerating himself from all blame when, in fact, he was the chief culprit behind the bubbles and housing debacle. <br />\nHarvard has a higher acceptance rate that that of a new Wal-Mart in Washington DC for ‘associates’.\n<br /></p>\n"
