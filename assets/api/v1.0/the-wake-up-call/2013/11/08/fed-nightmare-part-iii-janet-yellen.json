  "content": "<p>The Bernanke replacement: Another money-drug pusher.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nStudied under James Tobin, an apologist for central economic planning which is behind the economic catastrophe we endure today. <br />\nThe only hope we have is that other members of the Board will come to their senses and force her hand. <br />\nThis could happen more quickly than you think. <br />\nYellen has been with the Fed almost all her professional life. <br />\nAnd, for the record, her forecasting abilities have been the dismal equal of Bernanke’s (and Greenspan’s). <br />\nUS Treasury busy pontificating on other countries’ ‘shortcomings’ forgetting to take the moat out of its own eye… Anecdotal horror stories of life in the US (a family who had money confiscated with no crime having been committed and no evidence of any crime; a New Mexico man undergoing deeply invasive cavity searches, again, with no crime or evidence of a crime having been committed. <br />\nMFGlobal customers will soon be completely made whole. <br />\nGovernment lying (again) about GDP statistics. <br />\nKarl Denninger finally throwing in the towel. <br />\nThe present and future critical shortage of doctors in the United States. <br />\nYet more TSA agents are to be armed. <br />\nEdward Snowden asked NSA fellow workers to ‘give’ him key logins and passwords, so… they did! <br />\nQuick stock market comment.\n<br /></p>\n"
