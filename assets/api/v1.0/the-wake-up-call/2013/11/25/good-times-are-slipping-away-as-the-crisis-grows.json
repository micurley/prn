The government has been useless at stemming the tide.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nCorruption has soared, denial reigns supreme and the public is treated with barely-concealed contempt. <br />\nCorporations are now more important than people. <br />\nAn excerpt from John Hussman’s weekly letter dealing with the absurdities of “quantitative easing” (money-printing) and we hear from David Stockman on the same issue, among others. <br />\nMore police brutality and subsequent attempted cover-up. <br />\nComparing US multi-nationals with German ones. <br />\nThe effects of stress caused by poverty. <br />\nPoverty figures appear to have been severely undercounted. <br />\nBy the count of PERI, 34% of Americans can be considered poor. <br />\nThe ultimate consequence of “quantitative easing”.\n<br /></p>\n"
