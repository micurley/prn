  "content": "<p>A long but very incisive interview with the head of The Automatic Earth blog site. I agree with everything she says.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nA far-reaching survey of her opinions on many matters pertaining to the future. <br />\nThis is a first for me – the longest interview the Wake-Up Call has ever transmitted. <br />\nWell worth your while. <br />\nA brief comment (from me) on America’s decision to ‘kick the can down the road’ on the debt ceiling and related issues. <br />\nA truly pathetic spectacle. <br />\nUpdate on the TPP. <br />\nInequality in America. <br />\nThe coming union of the largest European banks in 2014. <br />\nComment from David Stockman. <br />\nAnecdotal story about a drunken sheriff’s deputy trying to arrest a female soldier for not reciprocating his advances!<br /></p>\n"
