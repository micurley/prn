  "content": "<p>It is truly extraordinary: despite the trillions of dollars thrown at the economy there is no inflation.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nMoney is not the answer. <br />\nMoney leads to debt and debt leas to ruin. <br />\nThe government has learned nothing over the last thirty years. <br />\nThe supreme arrogance of Bernanke, who decided he in his infinite wisdom “understood” the great depression, is bringing the country to its knees. <br />\nFraud, stupidity, malinvestment, overindebtedness, all have conspired to lay waste the economy for generations to come.\n<br />\nA quick comment on the stock market. <br />\nOvervalued, overbought and maximum bullish – a poor mix for continued gains. <br />\nIPOs galore. <br />\nStock buybacks aplenty. <br />\nGurus uniformly bullish and coming on TV, talking up the market. <br />\nAnd the economy continues to contract. <br />\nThe top cannot be far off. <br />\nVoters very negative on the economy. <br />\nMore on police brutality. <br />\nBanks hiding their losses, courtesy of the government green light. <br />\nAlmost half of all corporate bonds rated by S&amp;P are “speculative” (a polite word for junk).<br /></p>\n"
