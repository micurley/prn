  "content": "<p>Quick comment on the government shut-down and debt ceiling fiasco.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nWe are witnessing what David Stockman calls the failure of the American state itself. <br />\nIt is careening wildly into dysfunction and incontinence. <br />\nVast sums of money transferred from the have-nots to the haves. <br />\nThe greatest heist of all time. <br />\nThe Federal Reserve is behind it all. <br />\nThere is no good reason for this and no possible positive outcome for the country. <br />\nI describe in graphic detail the scandalous ‘money-drops’ to favored institutions and financial organizations and the so-called “reasoning” behind the fund movements. <br />\nWhy is the Prime Minister of Malaysia critical of the TPP but America seems to take it lying down? <br />\nBoth countries are equally disadvantaged by this so-called “trade agreement” which is nothing of the sort. <br />\nThird quarter earnings reporting season has just begun and the results are grim. <br />\nBeggars now need permits in Middle Township, NJ. <br />\nFailure to possess one will incur the unfortunate beggar in a $250 fine. <br />\nHow delightfully humane! <br />\nThe Defense Department is ordering hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of equipment it doesn’t need. <br />\nWe all know why (don’t we?<br />\n).\n<br /></p>\n"
