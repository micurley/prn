  "content": "<p>My guests are Tom and Diane Vande Burgt.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n If you want a vivid real-life introduction to what’s the matter with biological psychiatry and better alternatives, this is it. <br />\n In the first half hour Tom describes what happened to him when he came back from Iraq with “PTSD” and was immediately put on four psychiatric drugs at once and thrust into a downhill course of medication spellbinding. <br />\n In the second half hour, his wife Diane describes how she developed a family-oriented alternative called Lest We Forget, a PTSD support group. <br />\n The show dramatizes what’s wrong and provides a model for what’s needed. <br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
