  "content": "<p>Two new legal cases provide encouraging news for psychiatric reform and patient care.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n In one case a Manitoba judge has rendered an opinion confirming my testimony and my written report to the court that Prozac drove a sixteen-year-old boy to stab a friend to death. <br />\nThat’s the first time a judge in North America has determined that an antidepressant caused a murder. <br />\n In a New Mexico case in which I consulted, a jury has awarded a $3.<br />\n2 million malpractice verdict in a Paxil suicide. <br />\n I devote this radio hour to discussing these and other cases, and describe how antidepressants and other psychoactive drugs can cause people to act in bizarre, out-of-character and destructive ways.\n<br /></p>\n"
