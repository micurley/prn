  "content": "<p>One of my most inspiring shows!  On this Valentine’s Day, I share thoughts about love with my dear friend, Dr.\n<!--more-->\nAdrianne Johnson–love in marriage and in every other aspect of life including therapy and the workplace. <br />\n And we disclose a lot about ourselves along the way. <br />\n What is love? <br />\n Is there love at first sight? <br />\n How to heal a broken marriage or friendship? <br />\n The difference between love and relationship? <br />\n How to overcome extreme loneliness? <br />\n Steps to take to find other people to love? <br />\nWe move back and forth between inspiring ideals and the details and practicalities of maintaining and growing a loving relationship. <br />\n And the first time ever, my wife Ginger surprises me by calling into the radio show to join us on the air. <br />\n I’ve always wanted her to do so, and now she does it as present to me on Valentine’s Day. <br />\n It’s a show about happiness and how to achieve it. <br />\n  You can meet Adrianne, along with Ginger, at our upcoming Empathic Therapy conference (www.empathictherapy.<br />\norg), April 8-10 in Syracuse.\n<br /></p>\n"
