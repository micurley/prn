Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nPorter is one of the most thoughtful persons I know. Join the two of us as we talk about ”what helps us to heal ourselves and others,” ”embracing human spiritual diversity,” and encouraging alternative or complementary health practices.<br />\n As these radio discussions often do, we move easily from the theoretical to the practical in regard to living life to the fullest.\n<br /></p>\n"
