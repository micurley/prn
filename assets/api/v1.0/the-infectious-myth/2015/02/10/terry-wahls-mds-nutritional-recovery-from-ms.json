  "content": "<p>Terry Wahls is another example of a miraculous recovery after rejecting standard medical advice.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nBut, in this case it was a mainstream MD who had this experience. <br />\nTerry Wahls tells David about her descent into Multiple Sclerosis (MS) over a period of years, until she got to the point where she could no longer work, and spent most of her time in a wheelchair. <br />\nShe had found that a so-called “paleo” diet (heavy on meats, including fat, and vegetables, with few carbohydrates) had stopped her symptoms from worsening, but was not helping her improve. <br />\nShe used her still functioning mind to design her diet more scientifically, and then within a few months she was walking without assistance, and within a year rode a bicycle 30 kilometers.\n<br />\n \nTerry was anxious to share her personal discovery and, in doing so, discovered that it worked for many modern diseases, that are created or exacerbated by the modern low fat, high carbohydrate diet. <br />\nThis eventually led to her book, “The Wahls Protocol” and also dietary research on MS and other diseases.\n<br />\n \nThis is a fascinating discussion that will probably lead many listeners to read her book or recommend it to others. <br />\nYou can find more at http://terrywahls.com, including how to read a sample or obtain a copy of her book, watch videos,  and donate to her research projects. \n<br /></p>\n"
