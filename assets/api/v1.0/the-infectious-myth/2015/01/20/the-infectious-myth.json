  "content": "<p>David speaks with Wayne Rohde about “The Vaccine Court”, the title of his 2014 book, and the common name for the<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\npseudo-legal tribunal of the US National Vaccine Injury Program. <br />\nThe Vaccine Court began in October 1988 as a way to transfer responsibility for compensation to the US government, away from pharmaceutical companies. <br />\nThis followed massive compensation award to victims of the DPT vaccine, and also the mid-1970s Swine Flu vaccination program. <br />\nThe Vaccine Court is funded by a small fee attached to each vaccine sold.\n<br />\nWayne describes many of the problems with the Vaccine Court, including a cap on compensation, the lack of publicity (even though it’s mandated by legislation) and the relatively short time period after vaccination during which a petition can be made. <br />\nPerhaps the major problem is the gradual removal of conditions from the list of side effects associated with each vaccine, which forces people, often parents, into a more legalistic process, involving lawyers and high costs.<br />\n \nOver the years compensation has become more and more difficult to obtain. <br />\nThis leaves parents, in particular, forced to try to manage the 24-hour care for seriously injured children on their own, worrying about the future of their child when they pass on. <br />\nWayne Rohde speaks personally about this, being the father of a vaccine-injured son, who is now 17 years old. <br />\nThey realized that the problem was vaccine induced too late to get compensation, so the costs of daily assistance with their son is borne completely by them.<br /></p>\n"
