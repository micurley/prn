  "content": "<p>Lisa Bloomquist is someone who believes she was injured by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, of which the most famous one is<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nCipro. <br />\nShe struggled to recognize the strange but serious symptoms this formerly very active woman had. <br />\nShe reached out to others having similar problems, and she did a lot of scientific research as well. <br />\nOne she started to reclaim her health she began collating the stories of many other people, and trying to raise awareness of the problems these antibiotics can cause.\n<br />\n \nLisa believes that there are poorly studied interactions between the medications and other drugs. <br />\nBecause the drug is so tightly bound by the body, the side effects can occur quite some time after the antibiotics are taken.\n<br />\n \nLisa and David talk about what the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are, why they were designed, how they work, what side effects there are, and why she chose to focus on her own health rather than suing the drug company (hint: it probably wouldn’t have been possible anyway).\n<br />\n \nFor more information please see the websites http://fqwallofpain.com, http://floxiehope.com and http://saferpills.org<br /></p>\n"
