  "content": "<p>In Episode 40 David wraps up coverage of the Ebola epidemic, which is now winding down.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHe points out that the CDC, WHO and African governments have more money, and GSK has its vaccine trials well under way. <br />\nThe money has been made, the infectious panic is not needed any more.\n<br />\n \nThe vaccine causes David to segue into talking about the polio vaccine, because this is considered to be the most successful vaccine in history, except that simply examining the timing of polio epidemics tells us that this could not be the case, that the epidemic was declining long before the majority of people were vaccinated<br /></p>\n"
