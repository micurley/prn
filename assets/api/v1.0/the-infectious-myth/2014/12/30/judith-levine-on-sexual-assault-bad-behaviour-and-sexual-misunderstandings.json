  "content": "<p>David talks with Judith Levine in Episode 42 about sexual\nassault, particularly about whether new ideas about<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n“affirmative consent” are\ngoing to lead to injustices. <br />\nThe conversation also covers a description of\nrestorative justice, and how it can produce better outcomes for both the victim\nand the perpetrator (if both decide to participate), leading to behavior\nchanges without the lifelong consequences of a sexual crime conviction. <br />\nDavid\nand Judith talk about several recent cases, some of which involve minor sexual\nmisconduct, and some appear to involve the punishment of perfectly normal\nsexual behavior, based on this new desire to use harsh mechanisms to eradicate\nsexual misconduct on college campuses. <br />\nAnd why so much attention to campuses, where\nincreasingly financially privileged young people congregate, and not the home, workplace\nor the military or other domains? <br />\nIs this actually class bias masquerading as a\ndesire for justice?\n<br />\n \nJudith Levine is the author of four books, most relevantly\nthe award winning, “Harmful To\nMinors: The Perils Of Protecting Children From Sex”. <br />\nShe has also\nwritten many articles, such as  “To stop campus rape, let kids grow up”. <br />\nhttp://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/to-stop-campus-rape-let-kids-grow-up/Content?oid=2416807\nand “Campus Rules are about Punishment not Sex”, http://bostonreview.<br />\nnet/blog/judith-levine-yes-means-yes-campus-rape-punishment-sex.\n<br />\nShe is on the board of the National Center for Reason &amp; Justice\n (ncrj.<br />\norg).\n<br />\n \nYou can find out more about her at http://judithlevine.com.<br /></p>\n"
