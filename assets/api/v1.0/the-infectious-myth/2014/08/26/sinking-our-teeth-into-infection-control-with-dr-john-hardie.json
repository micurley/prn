  "content": "<p>Episode 26 looks at the issue of infection control in dentistry.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nYou might think that this is a dry issue of interest only to dentists, it actually provides us with a lot of information about the low risk of infection by the supposed hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV even when there is plenty of blood to provide a convenient route. <br />\nDr John Hardie discusses several cases of dentists and other medical professionals who had substandard infection control and yet did not leave a trail of infected patients behind them.\n<br />\nDavid and John spend a lot of time talking about the Dr Acer case from the late 1980s, a dentist who the CDC tried hard to paint as the first (and so far only) dentist to ever transmit HIV to a number of patients. <br />\nEven though Acer was HIV-positive, the worst possible situation, nobody could ever figure out how he might have transmitted HIV, and there was considerable evidence that his HIV-positive patients got their antibodies in some other way. <br />\nHis most famous patient was Kimberley Bergalis, a young woman whose emaciated figure testifying to congress became one of the most famous images of the early AIDS panic. <br />\nBut she was also taking high doses of the drug AZT, which can produce those very symptoms.<br /></p>\n"
