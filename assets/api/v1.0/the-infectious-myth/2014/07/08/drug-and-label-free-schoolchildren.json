  "content": "<p>In Episode 20 David talks with Sheila Matthews, co-founder of http://ablechild.org, an organization dedicated ensuring<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nthat American children can go to school free of coercion to take psychotropic drugs, and free of mental illness labels, such as ADHD. <br />\nSheila has lobbied against the increasing tendency of schools to try to diagnose children within a model that ensures that the large number diagnosed will be routed to psychiatrists and put on drugs. <br />\nShe had success with a Connecticut law that prohibited school officials from recommending drugs and with an FDA decision to put black box labels on anti-depressants warning of violent and suicidal behavior.\n<br />\n \nThe massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school, in Sheila’s home state of Connecticut, is one example of the association between a tragic event and a young man on psychiatric drugs. <br />\nSheila has investigated and is troubled by some missing information. <br />\nWhy are Adam Lanza’s medical records not available. <br />\nWhy are the contents of an envelope addressed to the school children not public? <br />\nWhy is the DNA on that envelope not of Adam Lanza but of an unidentified convicted criminal? <br />\nWhy has the information on two GPS devices found in his car and home not been made public? <br />\nDid Lanza go anywhere else, such as a mental health clinic, around that time?\n<br />\n \nThis is a fascinating and thought-provoking discussion.<br /></p>\n"
