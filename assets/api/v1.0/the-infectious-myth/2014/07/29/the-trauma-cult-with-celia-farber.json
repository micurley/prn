  "content": "<p>In Episode 23 David interviews pioneering and heretical AIDS journalist Celia Farber about the “Trauma Cult” and<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n“Totalitarian Science”. <br />\nShe compares the HIV=AIDS dogma, which she questioned in articles dating back to the late 1980s, to a totalitarian cult. <br />\nIn this cult HIV is not a positive God, who will bring enlightenment if you rigidly adhere to the cult leader’s dictates, but HIV is a Satan who you can never eliminate and, even if you did, you would never achieve the life and health you had before you started your battle.\n<br />\nAn interesting question that David poses to Celia, who is anti-communist through her own experiences growing up in Sweden, as well as from her father, well known right-wing radio host Barry Farber, is how such a totalitarian cult emerged from the country that has long claimed to be the leader of the free world, the United States.\n<br />\nThe conversation is made more scintilating because of the different outlooks that David and Celia on life and on the world.\n<br />\nIf you like what you heard listen to Celia Farber’s show “Conversations”, also on PRN, at Thursday 8pm ET. <br />\nHer website is: http://truthbarrier.com<br /></p>\n"
