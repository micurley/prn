  "content": "<p>In Episode 22 David talks with John Tirman, scholar and author of the 2011 book, “The Deaths of others: The fate of<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\ncivilians in America’s wars”. <br />\nThis book attempts to quantify the number of civilians killed during recent major American wars – Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. <br />\nTirman discusses the evidence that allow approximation of the vast scale of these deaths, by bombing, ancillary violence, the destruction of infrastructure, starvation, shooting by soldiers and a myriad of other causes. <br />\nHe discusses how household surveys can provide the most accurate information. <br />\nIn Iraq this estimated 600,000 Iraqi deaths (the majority civilian) by 2006.\n<br />\n \nTirman also discusses the indifference of the American population to civilian deaths in these wars, and the resistance of pro-war forces inside and out of government to admit that any inordinate number of deaths occurs. <br />\nOften there is a technique of focusing on minor flaws in the research, and trying to draw attention away from the big picture.\n<br />\n \nFor more information on John Tirman, including the other books that he has written, see: http://www.johntirman.<br />\ncom.\n<br /></p>\n"
