  "content": "<p>In Episode 19 of “The Infectious Myth” David talks with Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHenry Bauer, a chemist and former dean at Virginia Tech, about the same subject as last week – the science we’re not supposed to talk about.\n<br />\n \nLeading off with a lengthy comment from a guest about episode 18’s discussion with Simon Silver, David and Henry talk about science that was censored and then  proven right, science that is probably wrong but worth discussing, and the importance of discussing theories that have been rejected, so that science students can understand the logic behind the acceptance of modern scientific theories.\n<br />\n \nDavid and Henry discuss many of the flaws of modern science, such as a dismissal of ideas that come from outside the credentialed scientific community, a stubbornness to accept new ideas, and an excessive division of the world into black versus white.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about Dr Bauer’s fascinating explorations throughout the world of science at: http://henryhbauer.homestead.com\n<br /></p>\n"
