  "content": "<p>In Episode 2 David Crowe talks with Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nCharles Geshekter, a retired professor of African history, and an expert in Somalia. <br />\nHe talks about how the AIDS theory dumbs down our approach to African problems to a single virus but that, using Somalia as an example, each region has unique historical, cultural and geographical factors that have led them to their current situation. <br />\nDr Geshekter also talks about  how he first started to question the HIV=AIDS dogma because he could not believe that accurate statistics could be gathered from many countries in Africa, where even basic infrastructure did not function. <br />\nHe applied those questions to statistics in his home state of California. <br />\nThere, statistics are gathered with more rigor, but contain striking anomalies that nobody seemed interested in trying to explain.\n<br /></p>\n"
