  "content": "<p>David talks with veteran film maker Joan Shenton about her new joint product with Andi Reiss, “Positive Hell”<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\n(http://immunity.org.<br />\nuk), about a group of Spanish HIV-positives, who have either never taken AIDS drugs or took them only for a short time. <br />\nAll were severe IV drug addicts or, in the case of their medical advisor, Dr Manuel Garrido, a severe alcoholic. <br />\nAll of them conquered their addiction, and reclaimed their health, eventually rejecting their AIDS diagnosis.\n<br />\n \nThe interviews in this new video include a woman who went on to get married and have a child with her new husband. <br />\nDespite more than two decades of unprotected sex, he is still HIV-negative.\n<br />\n \nThe story of Dr Garrido is interesting because he is not just the medical advisor, but he has lived his advice, as he is also HIV-positive, and has also declined AIDS drugs.\n<br />\n \nThis should be the kind of hopeful story that will rock the world. <br />\nBut the experience of Joan Shenton shows that this will be difficult. <br />\nHer career as a successful medical documentary producer was destroyed in the early 1990s after a documentary first won a major award and then was the subject of a “Star Chamber” investigation.\n<br />\n \nJoan is the instigator of the Immune Resource Foundation website (http://immunity.org.<br />\nuk) that has a huge archive of critical AIDS documentaries and other video footage. <br />\nAlso with Andi Reiss she recently co-produced the film “Positively False: Birth of a Heresy” (http://positivelyfalsemovie.<br />\ncom) and is republishing her book this year, also called “Positively False”.\n<br /></p>\n"
