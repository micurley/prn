  "content": "<p>In Episode 29 David Crowe talks with Bobby Russell, falsely diagnosed with HIV infection in 2004.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt was not until 2013 that Bobby discovered what he had been searching for, that his hospital (University of Kentucky Medical Center) had performed a Western Blot confirmatory test back then – and it had come back negative.\n<br />\n \nHe had been on toxic AIDS drugs for almost a decade now, suffering major side effects, believing that he would die without the drugs. <br />\nBut now he knew for sure that they had just been destroying his life and his health. <br />\nWith this test result in his hands he launched a lawsuit but recently it was dismissed by the judge on the basis that he had waited too long.\n<br />\n \nIt is true that he had suspicions about his original Western Blot test before 2013, but without the test result in his hands he obviously could not launch a lawsuit.\n<br />\n \nYou can help Bobby fund an appeal by going to: http://www.gofundme.com/axwthk\n \nYou can listen to an earlier discussion with Bobby on the How Positive Are You podcast series at http://www.howpositiveareyou.com/2014/01/16/hpay076-bobbyrussell/, and a discussion with his lawyer at, http://www.howpositiveareyou.com/2013/10/31/hpay071-attorney-jonathan-dailey/<br /></p>\n"
