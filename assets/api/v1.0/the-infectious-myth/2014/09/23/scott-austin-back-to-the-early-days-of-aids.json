  "content": "<p>AIDS hit the entertainment industry hard in the 1980s and early 1990s, and motivated starts like Elton John and<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nElizabeth Taylor to start raising money for new drugs, starting with AZT in 1987. <br />\nScott Austin was a dancer back then, and has been in the entertainment industry for a long time. <br />\nUnlike many male dancers he was heterosexual.\n<br />\n \nThis meant that he was both an insider, to a relatively small, tightly knit community, and an outsider. <br />\nHe observed gay friends dying, but also observed that the promised/threatened epidemic among heterosexuals was not occurring, despite the many heterosexual relationships involving his female dancer colleagues.\n<br />\n \nScott’s discussion with David is a fascinating look back at the theatrical origins of this massive health fiasco, that is still with us today, and still often presented through a theatrical, dramatic lense.\n<br /></p>\n"
