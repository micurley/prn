  "content": "<p>In Episode 28 David talks about Ebola and uses the SARS epidemic of more than a decade ago as a cautionary tale.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nHe notes that SARS also initiated a worldwide panic based on scanty evidence, that the fear launched unproven and aggressive treatments, and there is evidence that the high death rate was due to the overreaction of medical authorities and not the disease.\n<br />\n \nDavid reads from his SARS chapter in the book that he is writing, “The Infectious Myth” and draws parallels with the ongoing story of Ebola. <br />\nSARS, at the end, was blamed for killing well under 1,000 people, yet caused widespread panic in East Asia and Canada (especially Toronto), and disappeared virtually without a trace within one year of its supposed origin in November 2002.\n<br /></p>\n"
