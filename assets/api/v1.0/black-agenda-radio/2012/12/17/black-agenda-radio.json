  "content": "<p>Fiscal Cliff is Diversion from Corporate Tax Avoidance\n“To some extent, the fiscal cliff debate is a farce,” said Eric<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nLeCompte,  executive director of Jubilee USA Network, which estimates that  corporations and wealthy individuals avoid paying $150 billion a year to  the US Treasury through loopholes and offshore havens. <br />\n“If we were to  close the corporate offshore tax loopholes, not only would the fiscal  cliff debate be over, but we would have more revenue than we would know  what to do with,” said Compte. <br />\nThe fiscal cliff “gap” represents only  $109 billion.\n<br />\nUN Urges All Nations Provide Universal, Affordable Healthcare\nThe United States joined  in a United Nations resolution calling on member countries to establish  “universal” and “affordable” healthcare systems. <br />\nHowever, “the United  States has actually taken us in the opposite direction,” said Dr Margaret Flowers,  of Physicians for a National Healthcare Program. <br />\nObamacare “further  privatizes health care,” said Flowers. <br />\n“Every industrialized nation that  has an effective, universal national healthcare program uses a  publicly-financed, not a market-based, approach.<br />\n”\nUN Sets Goals for Haiti Cholera, But Avoids Culpability\nAt least 7,000 people  have signed a petition, backed by filmmaker Oliver Stone, to pressure  the United Nations to accept responsibility for the cholera epidemic  that has killed 8,000 Haitians and sickened half a million more. <br />\nThe UN  announced plans to raise a $2.<br />\n27 billion anti-cholera war chest, but  fails to admit that the disease was brought to Haiti by UN soldiers, or  to ensure that “this kind of disaster doesn’t happen again in another  country where there are peacekeepers,” said Beatrice Lindstrom,  staff attorney for the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. <br />\n The Institute filed suit on behalf of cholera victims, a year ago.\n<br />\n“The people of Haiti never asked for UN troops,” said Robert Naiman,  policy director for Just Foreign Policy. <br />\nNaiman said pressure should be  brought on the United States and France, which backed a 2004 coup in  Haiti and then called in UN troops to stabilize the coup regime. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Post-Election Debate in Philly\nAttorney and talk show  host Michael Coard faced off against veteran activist and professor of  African American studies Anthony Monteiro, in a debate at Temple  University. <br />\nCoard attacked Monteiro’s revolutionary politics, saying:  “If you despise what President Barack Obama has done, you should despise  even more what Mitt Romney” and fellow Republicans would do. <br />\nDr  Monteiro pointed out that Martin Luther King Jr. <br />\nbroke with President  Lyndon Johnson “in principle over the war in Vietnam,” and would surely  break with Obama’s wars if he were alive, today. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Israelis “On Thin Ice”\nIsrael’s aggressive  policies will backfire in the new conditions that prevail “in this  Islamist Spring that is spreading throughout the region,” said Dr Gerald Horne,  of the University of Houston. <br />\n“The Israelis aren’t going to be very  pleased with their new neighbors, and their new neighbors will not be  very pleased with the Israelis, either. <br />\nSo the Israelis would be advised  to negotiate while there’s still time,” he said. <br />\nDr Horne spoke on  Regent Radio, in Toronto, Canada.\n<br /></p>\n"
