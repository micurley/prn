  "content": "<p>‘Bringing Banksters to Heel—How to Fundamentally Restructure the US and Global Banks’</p>\n\n<p>“Dr.\n<!--more-->\nJack Rasmus today interviews special guest, Ellen Brown, globally recognized expert on debt and banking abuses.  After nearly $20 trillion in bank bailouts by governments in US, Europe, and Japan since 2008, the banksters continue their old practices still today, more than four years later.<br />\n  As the banking crisis deepens today in Europe, threatening to engulf the global financial system again, banksters everywhere continue to oppose and water-down financial reform, engage in their speculative excesses once again, launder money to drug cartels and terrorists, and return to their old practices that gave us the banking crash of 2008. <br />\nDr Rasmus and Ellen Brown discuss alternatives, like Utility Banking, to the corrupt, broken banking system today.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>Jack’s guest, Ellen Brown is an attorney and president of the Public Banking Institute.<br />\n  In Web of Debt, her latest of eleven books, she shows how a private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves, and how we the people can get it back. <br />\nHer websites are http://WebofDebt.com, http://EllenBrown.com, and http://PublicBankingInstitute.org.  “<br /></p>\n"
