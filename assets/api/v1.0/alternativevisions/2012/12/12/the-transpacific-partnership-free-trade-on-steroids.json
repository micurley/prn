  "content": "<p>Today Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nRasmus will discuss the emerging ‘Transpacific Partnership’ Free Trade agreement that has been quietly been taking shape behind the scenes, largely unreported  by the press, that will result in a major negative impact on jobs and wages of American workers.  Lost in all the talk about fiscal cliff negotiations, negotiations between governments of the pacific rim, with the direct participation of scores of multinational corporations, are taking place as we talk.<br />\n  Jack will welcome his guest today, Art Stamoulis, on the subject.\n<br />\nArthur Stamoulis is executive director of Citizens Trade Campaign, a national coalition of labor, environmental, family farm and consumer organizations that works together on questions of international trade policy. <br />\nTheir current focus is stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. <br />\nCitizens Trade Campaign organized demonstrations outside TPP negotiating rounds in Virginia, California, Texas, and Illinois, and were the first to publish leaked text of several propo9sed TPP chapters.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n"
