  "content": "<p>Jack Rasmus gives his initial commentary on the Nov.\n<!--more-->\n4 US midterm elections and what comes next in 2015-16.  Prior predictions that Republicans would win at least 7 seats in the Senate have been confirmed (but two more seats, Alaska and Louisiana, most likely to soon go Republican as well.<br />\n  The roots of the ‘shellacking 2’  on Nov. <br />\n4 lay in Obama and Democrat policies adopted in summer 2010, Jack explains in detail, as well as Democrat refusal to act decisively since 2012 on immigration reform, youth jobs and education debt, and on union labor issues—the three key constituencies that gave Obama one more chance in 2012 but abandoned him and Democrats last week. <br />\nJack contrasts Obama’s midterm 2010 weak response to help ‘main street’ to Roosevelt’s 1934 midterm election decision to press ahead, despite intense business opposition, with ‘bailing out main street’ with his(FDR’s) New Deal announced in 1934 and launched 1935 after Democrats swept their ‘midterms’ in Nov. <br />\n1934. <br />\nNow emboldened Republicans will go on the offensive in 2015-16, Jack predicts, making their past (2010-14)attitudes appear friendly in comparison. <br />\nMore George W. <br />\nBush initiatives now return. <br />\nHigh on agenda—corporate tax cuts, free trade, deficit cuts, immigration reform mothballing, more support for wars in middle east, Ukraine, and elsewhere. <br />\nWill Obama stand up and veto and initiate executive action and orders? <br />\nDon’t count on it. <br />\nJack’s prediction: he’ll turn to Clinton ‘triangulation’ (i.e concessions) politics more likely, as Mr President ‘Jello’ (ie stands in place, makes believe he’s moving but doesn’t) likely becomes a Bill Clinton ‘retread’ in final two years.<br />\n  In the second half of show, Jack continues his interview with Mark Dudzic, main organizer of the 1993-2007 ‘labor party’ initiative in the USA. <br />\nBoth discuss what are the lessons of that failed labor party effort, can it ever be revived and, if so, how in practical terms?\n<br /></p>\n"
