  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus discusses in detail last Friday’s employment report by the government, this week’s agreement by Congress on a budget until October 2014, and the performance of Bernanke’s Federal Reserve as he retires on January 31.  Jack describes the December jobs report as a disaster, not just in terms of a dramatic drop in job creation but in the even greater exodus of workers from the labor force.<br />\n  Jack refers to his prediction of last November that December jobs creation would falter (see his ‘False Positives’ blog articles). <br />\nCongress’s just approved passage of another $1.<br />\n1 trillion budget bill is then analyzed. <br />\nThe show concludes with a brief assessment of the performance of Bernanke as Federal Reserve chair the past 7 years, showing how ‘shadow banks’ and ‘very high net worth’ investors have been the major beneficiaries, with financial asset increases in excess of ten trillion dollars since the financial crash.\n<br /></p>\n"
