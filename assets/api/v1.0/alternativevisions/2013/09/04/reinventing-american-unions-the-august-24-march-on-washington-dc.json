  "content": "<p>Dr.\n<!--more-->\nJack Rasmus provides his take on the subject of Union-Community Strategic Alliances and the upcoming AFLCIO convention where membership for non-union community groups in the federation will be considered.<br />\n  Jack explains why Union Labor is in a deep crisis today, with both its ‘workplace’ strategy’ and ‘political strategy’ in shambles. <br />\nReinventing American union labor will require changes in its mission, objectives, as well as strategies. <br />\nAnd this cannot happen without a major organizational restructuring at the grass roots levels, creating new institutions for labor-community action. <br />\nJack outlines those institutions and organizational changes.\n<br />\nIn the second half of the show, Jack’s guest is Jerry Gordon, longtime representative for the Food &amp; Commercial Workers union, and today secretary for the recently formed national Labor Fightback Network that played a key role in organizing union turnout for the August 24, 2013 march on Washington.<br />\n  Gordon reports on the march, its strengths and weaknesses, and what’s necessary going forward to build labor-community protests and demonstrations.\n<br />\nNext week grass roots ‘Workers Centers’ in the US. <br />\nAnd don’t miss the Sept. <br />\n18 Alternative Visions show, where guests will be local labor folks reporting back as delegates to the Sept. <br />\n8-11 AFLCIO national convention.\n<br /></p>\n"
