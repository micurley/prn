  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus offers an analysis of the current state of the US economy contrary to the hype of recent official and pro-business commentary. <br />\nA closer look at the US economy at year end 2012 and projections for the next several months is the topic of discussion.<br />\n  Why did US GDP collapse last quarter? <br />\nWhat will it look like going forward? <br />\nWhy the jobs numbers for January were in fact disappointing? <br />\nIs there really a housing sector recovery underway? <br />\nDr Rasmus will explain why the dual dangers of excess debt amidst declining household income for more than 100 million families is the real driver of the US economy and why the US economy will continue to ‘bump along the bottom’ and continue to stagnate.\n<br /></p>\n"
