  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus continues with his series on predicting the future direction of the US economy.<br />\n  Today’s show consider in depth and detail the recent 1st Quarter GDP numbers as well as last week’s April jobs report. <br />\nDr Rasmus explains how average GDP real per capita growth the past nine months is really only about 1%, after adjusted properly for real inflation and after temporary factors in each of the last three quarters are accounted for.<br />\n  April jobs numbers were also far weaker than reported, with the majority of jobs part time or temporary. <br />\nThe US job market long term is also ‘marking time’, churning out permanent for part time/temp, high wage for low wage, and new hires for millions leaving the labor force.\n<br />\nNext week, May 15, Dr Rasmus discusses the economy with Rick Wolff, Shadow Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, of the just formed Green Shadow Cabinet\n<br /></p>\n"
