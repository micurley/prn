  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus provides his analysis on the current government shutdown and the repeat of the debt ceiling crisis coming by mid-October and their possible negative impacts on the economy. <br />\n Rasmus then considers the ‘other policy crisis’–ie the US Federal Reserve’s QE and zero interest rate monetary policies. <br />\nHe explains why US monetary policy has also entered a crisis stage in recent months–ie proving increasingly ineffective at stimulating the real economy while simultaneously generating financial bubbles. <br />\nQE and austerity policies elsewhere in the world are discussed, with similar counterproductive effects on the real economy. <br />\nRasmus concludes the US and global economy is now entering a period of growing ineffectiveness of traditional fiscal-monetary policies generating a sustained economic recovery, at a time during which the US and global economies continue to slow or stagnate long term.<br /></p>\n"
