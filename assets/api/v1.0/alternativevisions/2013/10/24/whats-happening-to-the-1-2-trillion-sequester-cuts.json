  "content": "<p>Dr.\n<!--more-->\nJack Rasmus provides an update on last week’s interim ‘Government Shutdown-Debt Ceiling Extension’ deal in Washington and explains the real role and strategy of the Teaparty faction in recent months and going forward to the 2014 elections. <br />\nWith the Teaparty no longer the driving force, now the real negotiations begin (again) between Obama/Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans, returning to the ‘well orchestrated dance 2.<br />\n0’ laid out this past summer before the Teaparty’s intervention. <br />\nRasmus predicts there will be a government funding deal by the next January 2014 budget deadline, and there will be no repeated debt ceiling crisis on February 7, 2014. <br />\nThe coming Obama-Republican deal will now include major cuts to social security and medicare, and possibly more tax cuts for corporate America as well. <br />\nIn addition, the $500 billion in proposed sequester defense spending cuts will be further restored in the coming deal, and that restoration has in fact already begun. <br />\n(For a 35 min. <br />\nvideo presentation on “Why Social Security and Medicare Are Not in Crisis”, download Jack’s presentation at: http://www.kyklosproductions.com/videos.html \n<br /></p>\n"
