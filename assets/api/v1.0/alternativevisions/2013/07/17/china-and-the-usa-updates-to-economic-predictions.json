  "content": "<p>Dr.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus reviews the key trends in the US and China economies over the past 60-90 days, noting how both economies are slowing significantly.<br />\n  Jack discusses how these trends were predicted in his May 2013 written article, ‘Predicting the US and Global Economies, 2013-2014’. <br />\nThe recent shift and reversal in US Federal Reserve policy in the past month (future direction of QE and interest rates) is discussed in particular detail, as well as Jack’s key point that banks and financial speculators are now increasingly ‘addicted’ to free money (QE and near zero rates) from the Federal Reserve and central banks worldwide and threaten global asset price collapse at the prospect of the free money spigot being turned off.<br />\n” (see Jack’s ‘Predictions’ article on the PRN website, as well as his shorter item ‘Song of the Central Bankers’.\n<br /></p>\n"
