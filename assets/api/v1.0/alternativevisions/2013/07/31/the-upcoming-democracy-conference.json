  "content": "<p>Jack welcomes guests Cheri Honkala and David Cobb to discuss the coming August 8 Democracy Conference in Wisconsin.\n<!--more-->\nWill it be a step toward ‘convergence’, with progressive groups not only joining forces in day to day actions and protests but in the forging of a united program and initial organization?  Jack and guests talk about the need for a broader unification of those increasingly oppressed beyond just occasional protest actions and the need for a national convention of grass roots organizations to begin programmatic and organizational ‘convergence’ in the face of growing attacks on democracy and civil liberties in the US as well as continuing economic deprivation for the vast majority amidst the privileged minority’s continued growing income and wealth inequality.<br />\n  How can progressives get beyond the swamp of single issue politics and break out into independent political action.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>David Cobb is an attorney from Texas and an active leader in the ‘National Leadership Team to Move to Amend’ Citizens United, and defend against the growing attacks on democratic, voting, and other rights in America today. <br />\nHe is the chair of the ‘Commission on Corporations &amp; Democracy’ in the Green Shadow Cabinet. <br />\nCheri Honkala is a long time advocate for human and welfare rights, co-founder of the ‘Poor Peoples’ Economic Human Rights Campaign, and a Vice presidential candidate for the Green Party, as well as a member of the Green Shadow Cabinet.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>(Note: Tune in next week, Wednesday, August 7, to the Alternative Visions Show, when Dr Rasmus’ guests will be AFLCIO union activists who will discuss the upcoming AFLCIO convention in September and the union federation’s proposals for having community groups formally join the union federation. <br />\nWill this prove a major political shift in US grass roots politics, or just another weak form for getting out the vote in 2014 for the Democratic Party?)<br /></p>\n"
