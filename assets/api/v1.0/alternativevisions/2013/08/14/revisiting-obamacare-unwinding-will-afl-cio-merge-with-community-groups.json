  "content": "<p>In recent weeks, the Alternative Vision show has addressed the Obama administration’s postponing of important<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nprovisions of the Health Care Act and growing problems with implementation of the Act, as well as the largest US labor union federation, the AFL-CIO, discussion of allowing community organizations as members ‘with voting power’.  Today’s show revisits both these topics, providing updates in recent weeks.<br />\n  Dr Rasmus looks at the most recent delay of Obamacare provisions announced last week re. <br />\nsuspension of limits on ‘out of pocket’ expenses by individuals who buy health insurance. <br />\nThe only solution to what could prove the unraveling of the Act by 2015-16, he argues, is to substitute the current Act with a combined ‘Medicare for All’ and ‘Public Option’ add-on.<br />\n  A second follow-up to last week show’s topic of the AFL-CIO bringing in community organizations as members, to be decided at its upcoming Convention, is also discussed. <br />\nSome recent commentaries by community and union strategists on this topic are reviewed.<br />\n \n \nTune in next week to Alternative Visions as Dr Rasmus reviews his own 2005 recommendations for ‘reinventing American unions’ and the necessary major structural reorganization required for the AFL-CIO to survive in the 21st century—as written in his 2006 book, ‘The War At Home: The Corporate Offensive From Ronald Reagan to George W. <br />\nBush’. <br />\n Next week’s show will also include guests reporting back from the recent ‘Democracy Convention’ in Wisconsin. <br />\n(Watch for Jack’s articles on ‘The Stop-Go US Economic Recovery’ and ‘Reinventing the AFL-CIO’ posted on the Progressive Radio Network website.”<br /></p>\n"
