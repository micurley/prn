  "content": "<p>Jack Rasmus discusses the ‘Great American Tax Shift’, shows how the Corporate Tax has been steadily declining for<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\ndecades as a percent of federal revenues, percent of national income, and percent of corporate profits; why the Corporate Tax ‘effective rate’ is now 12%, not the official 35%; why corporations today pay state taxes of barely 2%, instead of official 5-10% rates, and only 2% on foreign earnings instead of 15-28%—for a total global real tax payment of 16%–not the 45%-50% corporate apologists claim. <br />\nJack explains how all this results in Corporate America now sitting on more than $10 trillion in cash and how that translates into income inequality trends and a global economy that is unable to fully recover from recession. <br />\nVarious myths about corporate taxes are also refuted (ie tax cuts create jobs, US corps have highest taxes in the world, corporations pay double taxes, etc.<br />\n). <br />\nAnd new corporate tax cut measures pending now in Congress in the Tax Code overhaul bill are explained.\n<br /></p>\n"
