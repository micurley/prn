  "content": "<p>Dr. Jack Rasmus and guest, Dr.\n<!--more-->\nMargaret Flowers, provide a progressive critique of Obamacare and its growing problems of implementation and coverage. <br />\nDr Rasmus explains how, and why, Obamacare will continue to unravel in 2014-15 and potentially implode, in whole or part, by 2016. <br />\nRasmus explains in detail how Obamacare has delayed and exempted businesses from participation in the program; why business penalties for failure to participate are in sufficient; why subsidies for individuals to participate are inadequate and won’t work; why enrollment will continue to seriously lag projections by wide margins in 2014; why the Act is the death-knell for union negotiation health plans; how businesses and health insurance corporations area increasingly ‘gameing’ the system. <br />\nRasmus explains how the Act is really a scheme for ‘moving the money around’, from those who now have coverage to those who don’t—where the money is moved first through the health insurance companies that skim off excess profits in the process—and how Obamacare should be understood as the extension of prior attempts to privatize health care via George W. <br />\nBush’s Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) in the past decade and Bill Clinton’s ‘Managed Health Care’ before that.\n<br />\n \nRasmus and Margaret Flowers explain how ‘Medicare for All’ is the only real alternative that will work, showing how its initial enrollment process, benefit coverage, and costs have been, and continue to be, far superior to the Obamacare-Bushcare-Clintoncare market privatization approaches. <br />\nRasmus forewarns that as Obamacare continues to unravel the real fight will begin over ‘Medicare for All’ vs. <br />\ntotal privatization of health care via ‘Vouchers for Some’ that conservatives are now preparing in the wings once again.<br /></p>\n"
