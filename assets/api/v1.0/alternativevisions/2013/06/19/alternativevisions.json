  "content": "<p>Are Producer Cooperatives (Worker Run Enterprises) A Political Strategy?\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nJack Rasmus interviews guest, Greg Godels, on the increasingly popular advocacy of producers coops, aka worker run companies, by left writers and intellectuals.  What are the positives of the proposals for worker coops?  The limits of the same in a market based, capitalist economy?  While the idea encourages workers to take control of their own working lives and challenges the idea that capitalist managers are needed to produce goods and services, does it also represent another limited example of single issue politics and solutions to the current economic crisis?<br />\n  Greg Godels presents his views on this topic, and he and Jack discuss the subject as strategy vs. <br />\ntactic.\n<br /></p>\n"
