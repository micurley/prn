  "content": "<p>Politics of Medicine \nPt 1 DEATH BY MEDICINE\n“In 2012, America has become the most overmedicated society in history.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIndeed, there is a medication for every condition…We never stop to question why we need all these drugs.  We never even notice that they aren’t making us better, or that we can’t get off them once we start taking them.  Why do we refuse to see that despite all these medications we are nevertheless the sickest industrialized nation on earth?” \nPt 2 THE FDA:  PIMPING FOR BIG PHARMA\n“Most Americans misunderstand what FDA drug approval means.  They believe that the FDA only approves drugs that are effective and safe, and that advertising of pharmaceuticals on television and in print has been approved by the FDA as well.  Ironically, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.<br />\n” \nPART III  SCIENTIFIC STUDIES: CLINICAL EVIDENCE OR A LICENSE TO KILL?\n<br />\n “After so many approved drugs and vaccines have later been shown to cause harm, somehow we miraculously wipe the slate clean after every incident and our faith in the pharmaceutical companies and the entire medical profession is restored to 100%”. <br /></p>\n"
