  "content": "<p>Charlene Spretnak is an internationally recognized author and was among the first wave of originators of what is now<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\ncalled “eco-feminism”.  Her writings have focused on such diverse, but interrelated topics, as social justice, ecological philosophy and Green politics, feminism and spirituality and religion.<br />\n  The British government’s Department of the Environment named her one among the one hundred eco-heroes of all time. <br />\nCharlene iscurrently a professor of women’s spirituality at the California Institute for Integral Studies, a research fellow at the Green Institute and an adjunct professor at Schumacher College in the UK, founded by the gandhian Satish Kumar who has been a guest on this program.\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>Charlene’s writings encompass a wide range topics from the goddesses of the Greeks, to the role of the feminine in Christianity, and social and historical criticism of modern culture and the environment.<br />\n  Her most recent book is “Relational Reality: New Discoveries of Interrelatedness that are Transforming the Modern World” which challenges the older mechanistic view of the universe and society that continues to dominate our major dominant institutions.\n<br /></p>\n"
