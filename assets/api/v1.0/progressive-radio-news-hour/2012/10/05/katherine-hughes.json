She’s been defending civil liberties since age 14.\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nIt inspired her to become an ACLU court watcher throughout Dr Rafil Dhafir’s entire 17 week 2004-05 trial. <br />\nIt was rigged to convict.\n<br />\nRafil is a true humanitarian. <br />\nNonetheless, he was convicted on 59 of 60 bogus counts. <br />\nHe was sentenced to 22 years in prison for being Muslim at the wrong time in America.\n<br />\nThat topic, the latest information on Dhafir’s status, and persecuting Muslims in America will be discussed.\n<br /></p>\n"
