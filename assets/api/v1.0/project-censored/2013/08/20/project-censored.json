  "content": "<p>This week’s Project Censored program focuses on the hazards of hydraulic fracturing (”fracking”) and federal officials’<span class=\"ellipsis\">...</span>\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\nattempts to downplay some those hazards.<br />\n  \nUS EPA officials denied last year that groundwater contamination in Dimock, Pennsylvania was due to fracking, although EPA’s own scientists knew that fracking was the culprit. <br />\nAnd, whistleblowers say, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used a false name in internal correspondence about the Dimock situation. <br />\nMickey Huff and Peter Phillips interview Steve Horn, writer for www.desmogblog.com, discusses these stories. Then Richard Heinberg of the Post-Carbon Institute speaks about his new book “Snake Oil: How Fracking’s False Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future.” Heinberg explains the hazards to water and air from fracking.<br /></p>\n"
