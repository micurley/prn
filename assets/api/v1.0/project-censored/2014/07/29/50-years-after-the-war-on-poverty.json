  "content": "<p>This week’s Project Censored show opens with economic issues, and wraps up with an interview with a VA whistleblower. <span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nFifty years have passed since LBJ announced the War On Poverty. <br />\nThe first guest, Keith Kilty, describes the how poverty was reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, before the programs were cut back and the poverty rate rose again. <br />\nThen economist Doug Orr of San Francisco City College looks at the stock market – how relevant are the market’s gyrations to the real economy? <br />\nOrr also explains “frontrunning,” a tactic used by market insiders to enrich themselves. <br />\nThe program concludes with a conversation about whistleblowing in the federal government, with Oliver Mitchell, a whistleblower in the Veterans Administration, and Marcel Reid, organizer of a whistleblowers’ summit (www.whistleblowersummit.<br />\ncom) in Washington, DC.\n<br /></p>\n"
