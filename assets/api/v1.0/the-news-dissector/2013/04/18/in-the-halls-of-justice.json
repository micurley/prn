  "content": "<p>One reporter had the scoop on the day after the 2012 election, when the lawyer for Bradley Manning, the young Army<span class=\"ellipsis\">…</span>\n<!--more-->\nprivate accused of leaking more than 500,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks, stood up in the courtroom and announced that Manning would be taking responsibility for providing some of the documents.\n<br />\n“This was an incredible development in the court-martial,” recalls Kevin Gosztola, an independent journalist covering the hearings for the websiteFiredoglake. <br />\nWith no mainstream reporter in attendance, suddenly, Gosztola was being called upon and linked to by news organizations all over the world, including FRONTLINE.\n<br />\n“That’s when I realized that I, as a more independent journalist, had a critical role to play,” he says.\n<br />\nWeeks later, on the two days Manning himself took the stand to testify about his treatment in military prison, more news organizations were represented, but most left shortly afterwards. <br />\nCritics turned up the heat on news organizations for not paying closer attention to the hearings.<br />\n  The New York Times own ombudsman took the paper to account.\n<br />\nGosztola is reluctant to beat up on the established news organizations — he says he recognizes many are strapped for resources these days — but still thinks the lack of coverage overall has been “shameful.”\nHe doesn’t let other independent journalists off the hook though.<br />\n  “We’re missing established journalists, but we’re missing independent journalists” Gosztola says. <br />\n“We’re missing other journalists from organizations based in the DC area who could be covering this story. <br />\n I don’t understand why there aren’t more journalists covering these proceedings.<br />\n”\nThe military justice system is not always easy to report on. <br />\nThere’s no rule that requires the military to make it easy for court reporters, and the amount of access can vary wildly.<br />\n  In the Manning proceedings, the government does not provide access to court filings, motions, or transcripts. <br />\nIn this regard, the military commissions at Guantanamo are a model of transparency in comparison.\n<br /></p>\n"
